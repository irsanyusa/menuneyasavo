Tyler Golden/NBC Reading Time: 2 minutes With her strong and emotional vocals when performing on stage, it’s surprising to know that Gina Miles has a sweet and small speaking voice. This perhaps is a message that she can power through until finals, although silent and innocent. Let’s get to know her more.

This perhaps is a message that she can power through until finals, although silent and innocent. Let’s get to know her more.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gina Miles is a Young but Experienced Musician</h2><p>Hailing from California, Gina Miles is an 18-year-old <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">singer-songwriter</a> who began exploring music since she was young. She inevitably grew up around tones and rhythms because her father was a disk jockey. By the time she was 12, she kicked off composing her own songs through an out-of-tune piano in her home. Thus, it’s no surprising that Gina has already dropped music of her own.</p><p>In January 2022, Gina released a six-track EP titled Who You Are. She has also produced music videos for two of the songs on the collection, “Incredibly Impatient” and “End with You.” At the Hard Rock Cafe in Sacramento, Gina celebrated Who You Are with a release show.</p><p>For Gina, music is a form of therapy. Hence, seeing music as an outlet to release her emotions, she wishes that her music could also serve as a safe space for others.</p><p>“I hope people get from my music a little bit of comfort in whatever form that comes in for them,” she said. “I just want people to enjoy the music and get lost in the music and the melodies.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-advances-into-the-voice-playoffs>She Advances into The Voice Playoffs</h2><p>During the Blinds, she impressed both coaches <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Niall Horan</a> and Kelly Clarkson. Yet, after intense banters between the two, Gina ended up going to Team Niall. In the Battles, she was able to beat Kala Banham in their “Skinny Love” duet. Subsequently, the young musician shone as she sang <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gotye’s “Somebody That I Used to Know.</a>“</p><p>Her full voice and substantial interpretation of the song didn’t fail to manifest. Amid this performance, Gina is no way exhibiting active and dramatic movements. Yet, she successfully managed to keep her audience fascinated.</p><p>Ultimately, Horan chose her over Kate Cosentino who sang a rock-heavy rendition of Blondie’s “Call Me.” As of now, Gina is bracing herself for the pressure of the Live Playoffs.</p><p>To know more about Gina’s journey on The Voice, be sure to tune in on Mondays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_DSmooth_Casey-DurkinNBC-220x147.jpeg alt="Get to Know D.
