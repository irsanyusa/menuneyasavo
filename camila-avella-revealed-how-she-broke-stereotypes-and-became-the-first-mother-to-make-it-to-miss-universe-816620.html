During this time, she got married and started a&nbsp;family. These experiences have made her feel more confident and prepared for the competition, proving that anything is&nbsp;achievable and there are no&nbsp;limits to&nbsp;what she can achieve.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c90/090/e10114570891266535cc85fea3.jpeg><p>Camila shared her deep passion for representing her home region, Casanare, and challenging stereotypes. Her goal was to&nbsp;become the first woman from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Casanare</a> to&nbsp;compete in&nbsp;Miss Colombia, and she achieved her <a href=# title=dream data-link=tag>dream</a> by&nbsp;winning the crown.</p><p>“My&nbsp;passion started because my&nbsp;department, Casanare, never sent many women to&nbsp;Miss Colombia to&nbsp;participate. I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the first girl to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. Nowadays, that dream has come true, I&nbsp;became the first contestant from Casanare to&nbsp;get the crown.”</p><p>“One of&nbsp;my&nbsp;biggest wishes was for my&nbsp;people in&nbsp;Colombia to&nbsp;find Casanare on&nbsp;the map. I&nbsp;feel proud that&nbsp;I was born and raised there. I’m a&nbsp;woman that always feels that attachment to&nbsp;her land, her culture, her race, to&nbsp;show what we’re made&nbsp;of,” Camila <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>.</p><p><h2>She had to&nbsp;postpone her dream.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/de9/052/6da47e507787c3a6889ef388e2.jpeg><p>Participating in&nbsp;pageants has been her long-time dream. She even received the decree accrediting her as&nbsp;the official representative of&nbsp;her Casanare department for the upcoming Miss Colombia 2018&nbsp;edition. However, certain <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>circumstances</a> arose, compelling her to&nbsp;postpone her dream.</p><p>As&nbsp;she sought to&nbsp;move forward, she decided to&nbsp;marry and start a&nbsp;family. During this period, she believed that her chances of&nbsp;being crowned had passed. However, when she learned that Miss Universe was now allowing married women and mothers to&nbsp;participate, she realized that her opportunity had arrived.</p><p>“I&nbsp;think what Miss Universe is&nbsp;doing is&nbsp;very important because they’re showing the inclusion they’ve discussed over past years. One role will not define&nbsp;us, and we’re finally breaking down those stereotypes that have held&nbsp;us back for so&nbsp;long. Ultimately, that Miss Universe decision motivated me&nbsp;to&nbsp;try again,” Camila <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>Her husband provides her with unwavering support.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c14/60e/6ef85a5915b2ac0d6ca6da3a79.jpeg><p>When Camila was asked about her husband’s support, the 28-year-old explained, “When my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I got married, we&nbsp;knew that we&nbsp;were going to&nbsp;support each other’s goals and dreams because that’s what marriage is&nbsp;about. It’s about teamwork.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/d06/5b5/2c01bb5aa4889c1fb5a4d6e406.jpeg><p>Even after welcoming their first daughter, they persist in&nbsp;supporting each other’s dreams and goals. They aim to&nbsp;demonstrate to&nbsp;their daughter that the sky is&nbsp;the limit.</p><p>“When my&nbsp;daughter was born, our priority became her, and we&nbsp;understood that as&nbsp;parents, we&nbsp;had the responsibility of&nbsp;showing her that she will never limit our achievements. It’s been the opposite; she’s pushed&nbsp;us to&nbsp;achieve our goals. I’ve received incredible support from my&nbsp;family and from Colombia,” she continued.</p><p><h2>Camila wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the best mother.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/b24/8ec/f8a4c55598a9961ac5d8155837.jpeg><p>Camila always wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the best mother, inspiring her daughter by&nbsp;working hard and achieving her dreams.</p><p>“What I&nbsp;want with my&nbsp;daughter is&nbsp;to&nbsp;always be&nbsp;the best mother&nbsp;I can be&nbsp;for her, the best wife&nbsp;I can be&nbsp;for my&nbsp;husband, and above everything else, the best woman&nbsp;I can&nbsp;be,” Camila said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/e9a/9fb/c189725afdb64630475849a214.jpeg><p>Even&nbsp;so, she doesn’t try to&nbsp;be ‘perfect.’ She understands that life is&nbsp;filled with imperfections, and the key lies in&nbsp;embracing both the triumphs and the challenges.</p><p>“That’s something that I’ve always wanted to&nbsp;inspire in&nbsp;her, and that&nbsp;I know in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few years when she sees my&nbsp;interviews, she’ll be&nbsp;like, ‘Wow, it’s so&nbsp;nice to&nbsp;see my&nbsp;mom achieving her goals, that she never considered me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;limitation,’” she elaborated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/a9a/94b/d987bb51719de21893cb9968e8.jpeg><p>Not only does Camila want to&nbsp;inspire, but as&nbsp;Miss Colombia and Miss Universe contestant, she also aims to&nbsp;uplift other children.</p><p>“I&nbsp;want women to&nbsp;teach their children that they’re not a&nbsp;limitation, that a&nbsp;child is&nbsp;the most beautiful thing that exists. Of&nbsp;course, everyone’s life experience is&nbsp;different, but once we&nbsp;understand that the love that our kids give&nbsp;us is&nbsp;so&nbsp;beautiful, I&nbsp;think our thoughts will change,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p>Being a&nbsp;parent is&nbsp;not a&nbsp;simple role. We&nbsp;must set a&nbsp;good example for our children, just like this mom who became the first <a href=#>Mom-Champ</a> in&nbsp;Martial Arts. She sets the bar high and shows her children that mothers are strong in&nbsp;every way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLCiucilmGaZppq5ra2Mq5yvnZGhsqV5x6iuZquYmnqjvs6knGarpJq%2FprvTsqeeq12Wu6V5wZ6amqWVYsGpsYyfoKurpGK6sMDHnqlmrJ9iuqK3xGagrWWkpHqutdKsZK6mmauys7%2FEZm9qbmZnfXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
