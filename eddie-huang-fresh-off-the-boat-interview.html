The show, part of <a href=# rel=noopener>ABC’s 2014-2015</a> lineup, is based on Huang’s New York Times bestselling <a href=# rel=noopener>memoir</a> of the same name.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As the first network television show in 20 years to be centered around an Asian-American family, Fresh Off the Boat has drawn comparisons to Margaret Cho’s 1994 <a href=# rel=noopener>All-American Girl</a>. Though Cho’s show was canceled after one season and criticized for stereotyping and depicting Asian customs as “<a href=# rel=noopener>weird and alien</a>,” Huang is quick to acknowledge its role in paving the way for Fresh Off the Boat.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m honored to be compared to Margaret Cho, because she’s a pioneer,” Huang says. “It’s important to compare and contrast, but recognize that everything is different and that 20 years ago, she was dealing with a whole different set of circumstances.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What Cho attempted was like “trying to play mahjong on King Arthur’s table,” according to Huang. But today, Huang says he feels empowered to depict his personal experience in an authentic manner, starting with things like <a href=# rel=noopener>reclaiming the term “fresh off the boat”</a> and including the word “chink.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Now, I feel like in many ways, we’ve broken the table, and said, ‘We don’t want it. We want a folding table, and we want to play mahjong on this table’,” Huang said. “I do feel like ABC is letting us work on a new table. It’s not that same Round Table that we’ve been forced to fit in our whole lives. They’ve really taken the reins off and let us do our thing.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Huang stopped by TIME’s studio over the weekend while he was back in New York City to train a chef at his Taiwanese restaurant, <a href=# rel=noopener>Baohaus</a>. In the video above, he talks about including violence in the show, the Fresh Off the Boat cast meeting his parents and how he feels about Asian fusion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZrcGJrg3R%2Fjp6bnaGVYrW2rc2gZJ%2Bqlai1brvFn2StoJVir7Ct02agp6yVp8OqsdZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
