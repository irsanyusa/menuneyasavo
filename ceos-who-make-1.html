Such forms of compensation are based strictly on company performance, and not on a guaranteed yearly paycheck. This means executives can align their personal financial interests with company interests.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So who are the <a href=# rel=noopener>executives</a> who can afford to collect a $1 a year salary?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Research engine <a href=# rel=noopener>FindTheBest</a> scoured the web to find out, compiling compensation information from the SEC on thousands of executives from publicly traded companies across dozens of industries.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Following is the resulting list of 25 CEOs, Chairmen, and other top execs who banked $1 salaries in 2013.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>$1 Salary Club | FindTheBest</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Among the richest members of the $1 Salary Club are Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth $50 billion), Google’s Larry Page (net worth $31.2 billion), and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg (net worth 27.9 billion). Their wealth is so closely tied to their companies’ stock, that receiving a few hundred thousand dollars extra wouldn’t make a dent.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Of the 25 execs above, Larry Ellison made the most last year ($79.6 million), mostly due to the $76.8 million he received in option awards. Mark Zuckerberg also concluded the year with more than $1 in his pocket, making $653,165 through “other compensation,” compensation that does not fit into the SEC’s other defined categories of compensation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Unlike Ellison and Zuckerberg, whose total compensation surpassed $1 in 2013 despite their salaries, Larry Page’s total compensation stayed put at $1. But that’s not to say he didn’t make money—Google’s stock price rose by <a href=# rel=noopener>56 percent</a> last year.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Two women also made the list, Meg Whitman (CEO of Hewlett-Packard) and Susan K. Barnes (CFO and Executive VP of Pacific Biosciences). Whitman, previously CEO of eBay, earned $17.6 million in 2013 despite her miniscule salary. Like Ellison, Barnes earned most of her money last year ($436,509) through option awards.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Among the executives who, like Larry Page, received only $1 in total annual compensation in 2013, are fellow billionaires Carl Icahn—Chairman of the Board of Icahn Enterprises whose net worth is $23.9 billion, and Richard Kinder—CEO and Chairman of the Board of Kinder Morgan Management whose net worth is $9.9 billion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZrcWdugHiFjpycqKtdrLWwecyaop5lYWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
