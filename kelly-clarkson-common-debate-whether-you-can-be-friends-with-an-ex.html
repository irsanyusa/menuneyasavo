He cited his own dating history as proof, sharing that he’s stayed friends with several women after splitting up. According to Common, as long as the breakup wasn’t contentious, he feels remaining friends is realistic.</p><p>“We go through stuff in the beginning but once we come to our grounds, it’s like, we both good people,” Clarkson said.</p><p>Unlike Common, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson</a> expressed doubts about smoothing over breakups into subsequent friendships. Though admitting she doesn’t despise all her exes, keeping things platonic poses challenges.</p><p>Clarkson worries crossing paths down the line may simply feel too awkward, especially depending on who initiated the split. She grants it could work for some but calls the idea mostly a “hard pass” for her personally.</p><p>At best, Clarkson says she could manage cordial interactions if forced to attend the same event as a few exes. However, going out of her way to nurture ongoing friendships feels like a stretch. The forced conviviality could get uncomfortable fast.</p><p>In the end, Clarkson concludes navigating former relationships differs from case by case. While she’s open to casually interacting with select exes, that doesn’t mean true friendship.</p><p>Rather than take a universal stance, Clarkson stresses circumstances shape her willingness to engage exes platonically. Compatibility, closure, and who’s moved on the matter. She’ll trust her instincts at the moment when deciding how much access to grant exes post-breakup.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-painful-divorce-complicates-prospect-of-ex-friendship-for-kelly-clarkson>Painful Divorce Complicates Prospect of Ex Friendship For Kelly Clarkson</h2><p>Clarkson’s reluctance to befriend exes seems influenced by her painful 2020 divorce from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brandon Blackstock</a> after seven years of marriage. The contentious split resulted in an ongoing legal battle over finances and custody of their children.</p><p>With emotions still raw, Clarkson understandably wants distance from Blackstock rather than some cheery friendship. Their marriage left deep scars not easily overcome.</p><p>Prior to her ill-fated marriage, Clarkson’s dating history included romances with fellow musicians like Graham Colton and Ryan Key. However, none is quite as traumatic as her shattered union with Blackstock. That experience alone may explain her wariness about ex friendships.</p><p>For Clarkson, the healthiest approach is setting firm boundaries with the past. Though she carries no hatred, moving forward means leaving certain relationships behind for good. With the baggage of divorce, she’d rather not reopen old wounds.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_ValChmerkovskiy_JennaJohnson_Michael-TullbergGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Jenna Johnson Pleads With Fans for Privacy After ‘Scary’ Incident Involving Infant Son" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdlk6S6rrvNZpuempGpsm7Dx56roZ2iYsawwYycmKdlkpp6p77InqWdq12strW0jJqlZp2oZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
