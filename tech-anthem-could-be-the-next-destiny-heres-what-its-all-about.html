"Anthem" seems to have a similar gist.</p><p>In "Anthem," your character is what's known as a "Freelancer." Bioware calls them "the heroes that leave the safety of the walls of Fort Tarsus, to explore the unknown and protect humanity."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This sounds similar to "Destiny": In that game, your character is known as a Guardian — a chosen warrior tasked with protecting the last city on Earth.</p><p>In "Anthem," players get an array of exosuits called Javelins, which provide superhuman abilities. They're also heavily customizable, so you can look and play how you want.</p><p>Similarly, in "Destiny," a big aspect of the game is customizing the armor and weaponry of your character, which you collect from completing missions and various activities.</p><p>Javelin exosuits come in all shapes and sizes, and each comes with its own unique playstyle. The "Ranger" is a well-rounded exosuit; the "Colossus" is more of a tank; etc.</p><p>"Destiny" lets you create a character from one of three different classes — hunter, titan, or warlock — but your character can't switch freely between those classes. You have to create a new character to experience each class in "Destiny."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In "Anthem," it sounds like you can switch up your exosuits — and thus, your playstyle — at these social hubs before you head out to explore the planet.</p><p>Notably, Bioware says "Anthem" will be experienced from the first-person perspective when you're in social hubs.</p><p>In these hubs, you can pick up missions from various people in town.</p><p>When you start exploring the planet, however, your view switches to a third-person view so you can better see your terrain.</p><p>Once you're in that open world, you can run...</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>... or fly anywhere that interests you.</p><p>You can even take your exosuits underwater, where you can discover new areas — or outflank your enemies, or just hide away for a bit.</p><p>Like "Destiny," you can also play all of "Anthem" with your friends. You can assemble a team of up to four people to tackle the planet's many threats.</p><p>As you explore the planet, you'll see caves to explore, beasts to take down, or a radio call might alert you to something happening nearby, or part of a quest you've decided to undertake.</p><p>It looks like "Anthem" gives you plenty of unique weapons to take out foes, from missiles to mortars.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>And, like "Destiny," expect to get rewarded often for completing these activities.</p><p>We're looking forward to seeing more of Bioware's "Anthem," which has a planned release date for "fall 2018." The game will be available on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. You can check out a 7-minute trailer showing off how the game works below:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7056aoWekmrCpecCnq6GdnWKwsMHLnWSbnV2ptaZ5zZ6vrWWUmsC1tc2yZKGdoprAbsPHmqtmoaSoeqK4y2aYm6elqXyuxsOzr6Gu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
