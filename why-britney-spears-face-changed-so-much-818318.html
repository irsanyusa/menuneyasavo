She confessed that despite trying it&nbsp;in&nbsp;New York City years ago, it&nbsp;never worked for her. For probably 10&nbsp;to&nbsp;15&nbsp;years, it’s been a&nbsp;disaster, and she had to&nbsp;hide for 2&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>She went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;reveal how her experience left her feeling disheartened. Seeing her friend’s sisters laugh about it&nbsp;made her question how they’d feel if&nbsp;they were in&nbsp;her shoes. While <strong>eyebrow mishaps</strong> are played for laughs, experiencing it&nbsp;in&nbsp;real life left her in&nbsp;tears. She couldn’t help but wonder when the effects would fade away.</p><p><h2>Experts noticed a&nbsp;major dental work in&nbsp;Britney’s appearance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6db/f9e/d2da4f59708b2f808684566ce0.jpg><p>Paul Marks/Broadimage/EAST NEWS<span>, </span>zz/GOTPAP/STAR MAX/IPx/Associated Press/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;heartfelt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a>, Dr. Gary Linkov, a&nbsp;plastic surgeon from New York City, examined Britney Spears’ transformation through photos spanning her career. In&nbsp;the YouTube analysis, the doctor started with images of&nbsp;Spears at&nbsp;17&nbsp;in&nbsp;1998, highlighting her naturally youthful features like her radiant complexion and vibrant eyes. He&nbsp;emphasized her lovely nose and full cheeks, signs of&nbsp;her youthful glow.</p><p>As&nbsp;the years progressed, he&nbsp;noted changes in&nbsp;her smile, suggesting she <strong>may have undergone dental work around 2002</strong>. «In&nbsp;2003&nbsp;at the age of&nbsp;22, Britney it&nbsp;seems to&nbsp;me&nbsp;has gotten some form of&nbsp;veneers. Her teeth have a&nbsp;different shape and color compared to&nbsp;prior [photos].» In&nbsp;the photos from the year 2004 to&nbsp;2010, he&nbsp;didn’t find any changes in&nbsp;her appearance that would suggest <a href=# title="plastic surgery" data-link=tag>plastic surgery</a>.</p><p><h2>Her nose looks slimmer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b9c/e5e/4248d55653baf23f93b7c01594.jpg><p>EVERETT COLLECTION/EAST NEWS<span>, </span>zz/RE/Westcom/STAR MAX/IPx/Associated Press/East News</p><p>For a&nbsp;while now, fans have been talking about whether Britney Spears had a&nbsp;nose job around 2014. Doctor Linkov weighed in&nbsp;on&nbsp;this idea, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a> that in&nbsp;2014 Britney may have had a&nbsp;rhinoplasty. He&nbsp;pointed out how <strong>her nose bridge seemed narrower </strong>that year than ever before.</p><p>He&nbsp;explained that in&nbsp;this procedure, the nose bones are broken to&nbsp;make them narrower. Linkov also noticed that the tip and wings of&nbsp;Britney’s nose appeared slimmer after this time. Then, in&nbsp;2015, he&nbsp;mentioned seeing «signs of&nbsp;a&nbsp;brow lift.»</p><p><h2>She might have fillers, experts say.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3d5/b02/5ad8f05753891225e3af356f15.jpg><p>The following year, Linkov <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a> that it&nbsp;seemed like Britney might have started getting some lip filler. He&nbsp;then examined a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;Spears from 2018 when she was 37. At&nbsp;that point, he&nbsp;noticed she seemed to&nbsp;have stopped getting Botox. He&nbsp;could see more wrinkles and lines, signs of&nbsp;natural aging that Botox usually hides.</p><p>However, the next year, he&nbsp;thought she might have started getting filler in&nbsp;her cheeks and under-eye areas. «To&nbsp;me,<strong> the cheeks are more full</strong>, especially medially where she&nbsp;— in&nbsp;the past when she was younger&nbsp;— had that volume and lost some of&nbsp;it&nbsp;with aging.» He&nbsp;analyzed red carpet pics of&nbsp;her from 2019 and made a&nbsp;conclusion, «It&nbsp;looks like she’s gotten some of&nbsp;that back, and the under-eyes to&nbsp;me&nbsp;also look less hollow.»</p><p>In&nbsp;2021, when the mom of&nbsp;two turned 40, Linkov suspected she got additional cheek filler, this time more in&nbsp;the outer part of&nbsp;her cheeks.</p><p>Each person chooses changes in&nbsp;their appearance, but the crucial step is&nbsp;learning to&nbsp;love themselves first. As&nbsp;they embraced their uniqueness, whether through hairstyles or&nbsp;subtle enhancements, they discovered that self-acceptance is&nbsp;the key to&nbsp;genuine <a href=#>transformation</a>.</p><p>Preview photo credit ASSOCIATED PRESS/East News<span>, </span>zz/GOTPAP/STAR MAX/IPx/Associated Press/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYybqaKsnprGbr%2FPnpirq12brqSxjJyfmqaXmrFuv85mpK6bmGKFcoSSam9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
