The good news is that these phrases are almost synonymous, and you can often use either without changing the meaning of the sentence. Both of you is more formal, while you both is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">less formal</a> and more common. However, there are times when a native speaker would choose to use both of you, even in informal situations. Let us explain!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=What-does-both-mean?>What does both mean?</h2><p>The word both means two things or two people together. It is always treated as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">plural</a>. It can occur after a subject or object pronoun with the structure <strong>pronoun + both</strong>. The difference is not visible with you, as you is a subject and object <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pronoun</a>. Both can also appear before <strong>of + object pronoun</strong>, as in the form both of you. To see the difference, take a look at the table.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pronoun + both</strong></td><td><strong>Both of + object pronoun</strong></td></tr><tr><td>You both</td><td>Both of you</td></tr><tr><td>We both / us both</td><td>Both of us</td></tr><tr><td>They both / them both</td><td>Both of them</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How to use both in a sentence</h3><p><strong>They both</strong> helped us.&nbsp;</p><p>We received help from <strong>them both</strong>. (This is not the most common form – see below!)&nbsp;</p><p>We received help from <strong>both of them</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>When in a sentence with a subject pronoun, both appears directly after the pronoun and before the verb.&nbsp;</p><p>I asked <strong>you both to stop</strong> doing that!</p><p><strong>We both want</strong> you to come.&nbsp;</p><p>The exception to this is with the verb to be, when it appears after the verb.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You are both</strong> being very naughty!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We are both</strong> extremely disappointed in you.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=You-both-vs-both-of-you>You both vs both of you</h2><p>As we said earlier, you both and both of you are almost synonymous in meaning and generally, you can use either without any change in the sentence.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Both of you</strong> are in trouble.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You </strong>are<strong> both</strong> in trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is more common to use both of you when you’re talking to two people in a formal situation. And, you both<strong> </strong>is informal and is often used to add emphasis after you, especially if you want two people to do something.&nbsp;</p><p>Formal:</p><p><strong>Both of you</strong> gave wonderful performances.</p><p>I would like to thank <strong>both of you</strong> for your help today.&nbsp;</p><p>Informal:</p><p><strong>You both</strong> need to tidy your rooms, right now!</p><p>I just love <strong>you both</strong> so much!</p><p>In English, we prefer to use both of you after a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">preposition</a>. You both is not incorrect in these sentences, it’s simply less common. Take a look at these examples:&nbsp;</p><p>We gave the bike <strong>to</strong> both of you.</p><p>He smiled <strong>at</strong> both of you.&nbsp;</p><p>We received help <strong>from</strong> both of you.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Is-it-the-both-of-you-or-both-of-you?>Is it the both of you or both of you?</h2><p>You will hear native English speakers using the both of you<strong> </strong>and both of you, but the second form is far more common. The article, the, is redundant in the phrase and, technically, incorrect – in fact, if you use a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grammar tool</a>, it will often mark it as wrong. Some people use it to add emphasis to what they’re saying, though if you want to be concise (usually, you do!), don’t use the.&nbsp;</p><p>Congratulations to <strong>the both of you</strong>!</p><p>Congratulations to <strong>both of you</strong>!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The both of you</strong> look very happy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Both of you</strong> look very happy.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>You both or both of you?&nbsp;</h2><p>Both are perfectly acceptable. In informal situations, choose you both, while in more formal situations, you might want to say both of you. If you have a sentence with a preposition, it’s more common to use both of you, though no one will bat an eyelid if you use you both. The only thing you might want to avoid saying is the both of you – the is redundant, so why waste words?</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
