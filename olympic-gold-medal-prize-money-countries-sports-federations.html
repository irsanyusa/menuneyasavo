And this year, some federations have made the groundbreaking decision to do just that at the Paris Games.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">World Athletics, the international governing body for track and field, <a href=#>announced</a> in April that Olympic gold medalists in track and field events will receive a reward of $50,000—the first of its kind for a sports federation. And in May, the International Boxing Association—which was <a href=#>stripped</a> of recognition by the IOC last year due to financial and governance concerns—<a href=#>said</a> it would offer $100,000 to boxing gold medalists, “setting a clear example for many on how international federations should be treating their champions.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The announcements have proven controversial. Other federations have <a href=#>claimed</a> such a move “undermines the values of Olympism” and is unfair to sports that can’t afford to offer prize money. The IOC has <a href=#>argued</a> that the federations should be focusing on reducing inequality within their sport instead of elevating their winners. Meanwhile, sporting bodies and <a href=#>athletes</a> have defended the merits of rewarding the best performers—who drive publicity and revenue for the Olympics and for their respective sports—and have called for more money to be passed to the winners across all the Olympic events.</p><h2 class="font-itc-franklin-gothic-std mb-5 w-full border-b border-time-gray-7 pb-5 text-center text-base font-semibold uppercase leading-tight lg:text-left">Your Guide to the Paris Olympics</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“While it is impossible to put a marketable value on winning an Olympic medal, or on the commitment and focus it takes to even represent your country at an Olympic Games,” <a href=#>said</a> World Athletics president Sebastian Coe in April, “I think it is important we start somewhere and make sure some of the revenues generated by our athletes at the Olympic Games are directly returned to those who make the Games the global spectacle that it is.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Aside from the select federations that will pay their champions, some countries also bestow bonuses on those who bring home medals—though the prizes on offer can differ greatly. Here are some rewards Olympic winners can reap:</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Cash</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In what may well be the single largest payout for an Olympic medal, Saudi authorities awarded karate athlete Tareg Hamedi 5 million riyal (about $1.33 million) after he <a href=#>narrowly missed the gold</a>—settling for silver after being disqualified over an illegal kick—at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other wealthy gulf states like <a href=#>Bahrain</a> and <a href=#>Qatar</a>, which have a history of poaching foreign athletes with lucrative deals, are also known for offering hefty rewards in exchange for sporting medals. In 2005, Qatar famously <a href=#>offered</a> top South African swimmer Roland Schoeman a multimillion-dollar contract, including a one million rand (over $50,000) bonus for every Olympic medal or world title won—though Schoeman ultimately rejected the offer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hong Kong’s gold medalists, if there are any, at the Paris Olympics will get among the largest cash reward on offer: <a href=#>HK$6 million</a> (over $750,000), as part of the city’s Athlete Incentive Awards Scheme, sponsored by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the city’s official betting organizer.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Similarly, Singapore, through its <a href=#>Major Games Award Programme</a> that’s largely sponsored by the national lottery board, offers S$1 million (over $700,000) for individual winners, S$1.5 million for winners of team events (like athletics relays or tennis doubles), and S$2 million for winners of team sports (like basketball or soccer). It also gives 50% of the aforementioned amounts to silver medalists and 25% to bronze medalists. So far, however, only one Singaporean has ever managed to claim the top prize: swimmer Joseph Schooling, who became the city-state’s first and only gold medalist after winning the 100 meter butterfly at the Rio 2016 Olympics.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Olympic gold medalists, under a <a href=#>government medal program</a>, receive NT$20 million (over $600,000) and a lifetime monthly stipend of NT$125,000 (about $4,000).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other governments that have offered (or pledged to offer) their Olympic champions six-figure cash rewards include: <a href=#>Indonesia</a>, <a href=#>Kazakhstan</a>, <a href=#>Malaysia</a>, <a href=#>Morocco</a>, <a href=#>Italy</a>, <a href=#>the Philippines</a>, <a href=#>Hungary</a>, <a href=#>Kosovo</a>, <a href=#>Estonia</a>, and <a href=#>Egypt</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In some cases, athletes get rewards from both their governments and national sports organizations. The Indian government offers Olympic gold medalists 7.5 million rupees (about $90,000), while the Indian Olympic Association <a href=#>separately rewards</a> them with 10 million rupees (about $120,000).&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Under the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee committee’s Operation Gold program, Olympic gold medalists <a href=#>receive</a> $37,500, while silver and bronze medalists receive $22,500 and $15,000, respectively. National sports organizations also have their own programs to reward athletes, with USA Wrestling’s <a href=#>Living The Dream Medal Fund</a> offering $250,000 for Olympic gold medals and USA Swimming offering <a href=#>$75,000</a> for the same.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Cars, houses, even cows</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In some countries, often in addition to cash, lavish rewards are bequeathed upon winning athletes, from luxury cars to apartments.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Malaysian authorities have promised their athletes <a href=#>foreign-made cars</a> if they bring home medals from Paris, while in Kazakhstan, Olympic winners are <a href=#>legally entitled</a> to apartments—the size of which will differ according to their medal color.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After Chinese sport shooter Yi Siling won gold in the air rifle event at the London 2012 Olympics, authorities of Guangdong province, where she resided, reportedly <a href=#>gave</a> her a cash reward of 7.65 million yuan (over $1 million), along with a car worth $30,000 and custom made alcohol. Other Chinese athletes, according to local media, have received expensive new <a href=#>homes</a> from real estate companies.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When Indonesian badminton gold medalists Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu returned home after the Tokyo Olympics, besides the cash reward from the Indonesian government, local authorities and entrepreneurs also <a href=#>showered</a> the pair with gifts including cows, a house, and even their own meatball restaurant.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Austria’s Olympic gold medalists, meanwhile, have <a href=#>previously</a> <a href=#>received</a> €17,000 (over $18,000) worth of Philharmonic coins, a popular bullion coin named after the Vienna Philharmonic orchestra.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In Russia, Olympic champions are <a href=#>typically</a> <a href=#>given</a> 4 million rubles ($45,300), along with expensive foreign cars, apartments, honorary titles, and lifetime stipends. Victory at the Olympics also often translates to more immaterial forms of success, with many high-profile athletes—such as wrestler Aleksandr Karelin, figure skater Irina Rodnina, and gymnast Svetlana Khorkina—embarking on careers in politics after retiring from sports.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“In our country, success at the Olympics is a direct path to the State Duma and power,” reads a 2016 <a href=#>article</a> in Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In some cases, just qualifying for the Olympics is enough cause for compensation: the Iraqi soccer team and weightlifter Ali Ammar Yasser <a href=#>received</a> plots of land, monthly stipends, and a reward of 10 million Iraqi dinars (over $7,000) each after securing their spots in Paris.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Nothing—besides pride</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The U.K., along with countries like Norway and Sweden, does not offer any cash reward to its Olympic medalists.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While some athletes have made clear that they think they should be paid, others think it’s unnecessary.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“All those gold medalists in athletics are capable of earning significant money before and certainly after Paris,” British Olympic champion rower Sir Steve Redgrave told <a href=#>BBC</a> after the news of World Athletics offering cash to winners, “so you’re giving money to people who already have it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meanwhile, Norwegian Olympic champion hurdler Karsten Warholm, who applauded World Athletics for its move, emphasized that the value of victory in the Olympics is often more profound than any pecuniary prize: “It doesn’t change my motivation to win because for the Olympics I’m not in it for the money,” he told <a href=#>Reuters</a>. “The gold medal is worth a lot more to me personally.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWlrhXOCjqijsqWgnrBus86lm2allZmurXnPq6CznV2ivK%2Bx2GaaqK2eqb%2BqsdJmqqmnoqnAbrLEnZyrmaSevK%2B%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
