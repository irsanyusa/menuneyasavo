Even if an artist doesn’t go on to win the season, they still have the title of “four-chair turn” to describe them.</strong></p><p>However, there are some four-chair turns that really stick with us even years later. A few of these artists won their season, while others simply left a lasting impact with their voice. We’ll be watching these auditions for years to come.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-javier-colon-season-1>1. Javier Colon – Season 1</h2><p>Javier Colon was the first-ever winner of The Voice, on Team Adam Levine. For his Blind Audition, Colon sang an acoustic cover of “Time After Time” by Cyndi Lauper. The simple, stripped-back performance showed off Colon’s beautiful voice. All four coaches were impressed, although it took Blake Shelton a little longer than the rest to turn. Eventually, he couldn’t hold back any longer.</p><p>CeeLo Green described it as “perfect,” while Levine called it “tasteful” and said Colon “showed a lot of restraint.” Shelton told Colon that he was already a fan, and Christina Aguilera loved that he made the song his own.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shhLMYmrPFc</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>2. Matthew Schuler – Season 5</h2><p>Sometimes, a singer is so good that they turn all four chairs in seemingly no time at all. That’s what happened when Matthew Schuler took the stage in Season 5 to sing Young the Giant’s “Cough Syrup.” Schuler had barely finished the first line of the song when all four coaches hit their buttons almost simultaneously.</p><p>Levine and Aguilera stood on their chairs after the performance, and Shelton approached Schuler to shake his hand while Aguilera hugged him. Schuler ended up joining Team Christina and made it to the Top 6.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1J8PN02KcA</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. Christina Grimmie – Season 6</h2><p>In Season 6 of The Voice, Christina Grimmie stunned the coaches with her powerhouse performance of Miley Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball.” Usher and Shakira turned around almost immediately, followed quickly by Adam Levine. Shelton eventually joined them when Grimmie hit the final high notes.</p><p>Levine said she was “more comfortable than I am” on stage. Grimmie joined Team Adam and finished the season in third place. The singer was tragically shot and killed in 2016 at the age of 22. Fans will never forget her incredible talent.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twgSCz7jiyE</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. Anthony Riley – Season 8</h2><p>In Season 8, Anthony Riley let out the first few wailing notes of “I Feel Good” by James Brown, and all four coaches almost immediately hit their buttons to turn around. Then they just enjoyed the rest of Riley’s energetic performance, which included some sweet dance moves.</p><p>The coaches gave Riley a standing ovation for good measure, and they proceeded to fight over him. Riley ended up joining Team Pharrell, and he made it to the Battles before dropping out and later entering a rehab program. Sadly, <a href=#>Riley passed away</a> of an apparent suicide in 2015 at the age of 28.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. Jordan Smith – Season 9</h2><p>Jordan Smith delivered one of the most unforgettable auditions in The Voice history in Season 9 of the show. The singer performed Sia’s “Chandelier,” and he wasn’t at all what the coaches expected. Gwen Stefani was so impressed, she hopped on stage to give Smith a hug.</p><p>“You do not look like your voice,” Stefani told the singer, while Pharrell added that it was “super cool.” Levine told him he could tell he was ready for the show. Smith chose to join Team Adam, and he won the entire season.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>WHO WOULD BE YOUR COACH ON ‘THE VOICE’?

Wé McDonald – Season 11</h2><p>In Season 11, 17-year-old Wé&nbsp;McDonald shocked the coaches with her deep voice on a cover of “Feeling Good” by Nina Simone. This was contrasted by her higher-pitched speaking voice. McDonald’s powerhouse vocals turned all four chairs, with Levine waiting until the very end of the song.</p><p>The coaches’ positive feedback made McDonald emotional as she shared the she had been bullied. McDonald chose to join Team Alicia, and she ended up finishing the season in third place.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. Maelyn Jarmon – Season 16</h2><p>All four coaches were captivated by Maelyn Jarmon’s Season 16 Blind Audition to “Fields of Gold” by Sting. Jarmon was a four-chair turn, but her coach John Legend was actually the last one to hit his button. The coaches watched in quiet awe as Jarmon finished her performance.</p><p>The singer’s mother was emotional over the four-chair turn, as she could be seen crying backstage. Jarmon chose to join Team Legend, and she ended up winning the entire season, earning her coach his first win in his very first season on the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. Katie Kadan – Season 17</h2><p>In Season 17, Katie Kadan took the stage to belt out “Baby I Love You” by Aretha Franklin while playing the keyboard. Legend was the first coach to turn his chair, followed by Shelton, who blocked Kelly Clarkson. Eventually, Stefani couldn’t resist turning around to join them.</p><p>Clarkson was furious over Shelton’s block, throwing one of her team jackets on the ground in frustration. The block didn’t even pay off for him, as Kadan chose to join Team Legend, finishing the competition in third place.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. Tamara Jade – Season 19</h2><p>If you watched any promos for Season 19 of The Voice, you likely heard a snippet of Tamara Jade singing Lizzo’s “Cuz I Love You.” And with good reason. Jade knocked it out of the park with her audition, turning Clarkson’s and Legend’s chairs almost immediately. Shelton and Stefani eventually followed.</p><p>Legend said Jade’s performance showed that she “can do literally everything.” The singer chose to join his team, and she ended up making it to the Semifinals of Season 19.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HW9zvEIvVE</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. Wendy Moten – Season 21</h2><p>Wendy Moten has consistently proven herself to be a frontrunner in Season 21 of The Voice, and that includes her Blind Audition. Moten sang “We Can Work It Out” by the Beatles and made it her own. All four coaches turned around, with Shelton blocking Legend from getting Moten on his team.</p><p>Ariana Grande said she was “shook” by Moten’s performance, and Shelton said it was in the top three Blind Auditions of all time on the show. Moten chose to join Team Blake, and she’s made it to the Top 13 of Season 21.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRvtqi6RMfM</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/NUP_195975_00991.jpg alt="‘The Voice’s Girl Named Tom Tops the U.S. and Canadian iTunes Charts" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqyfpXpyfIytn55lpqS2pLGMnKanrJWowaK606xksKCfYrKivs2em2aZXZu8tr6MnJ%2BaoaJiwba%2BzWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
