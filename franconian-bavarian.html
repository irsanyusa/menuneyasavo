Isn’t Franconia in Bavaria? 
Oh dear, don’t say that down south, or you’ll be in for a very, very long lecture. 
Where is Franconia? The northwest corner of Bavaria is the cultural region of Franconia, or Franken auf Deutsch."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It includes Nuremburg, Erlangen, Bamburg, Würth, Würzburg, and Bayreuth, but doesn’t extend as far south as Munich.</span></p><p><span>Although it’s not recognised as a Bundesland, it is definitely a cultural identity that everyone in Germany recognises. It even has its own anthem: the Frankenlied. The region is split into Unterfranken, Mittelfranken, and Oberfranken. There several dialects that are called Franconian, but generally it is the East Franconian ones that most people mean when they say Fränkisch.</span></p><p><span>The Franconian flag is divided into two horizontal bars, the top one is red and the bottom is white, you whenever you see patriotic Franconian things going on, there will be lots of red and white around!</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bigstock-Bamberg-Town-Of-Bamberg-View-328030093-1024x683.jpg alt="Bamberg. Town of Bamberg view from Michaelsberg vineyards to Bamberger dom square, Upper Franconia, Bavaria region of Germany" width=1024 height=683 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><strong>But wait, isn’t Franconia IN Bavaria?</strong></h3><p><span>Yes, you’re right, good spot.</span></p><p><span>Franconia is indeed inside the political borders of Bavaria, but ask someone from that region and if their family is historically from the region they will definitely say they are Franconian.</span></p><p><span>Franconians in general distance themselves from the Bavarian stereotypes of Lederhosen, Dirndls, and Weißwurst, but don’t let that fool you, they are champion beer brewers. Just in the Franconian region alone there are 300 breweries. Of course, their wine region around the river Main is also famous. So while Franconia is in Bavaria, they are a culture apart, and their <span><strong><a href=#>dialect</a> </strong></span>makes this distinction very clear!</span></p><h4><strong>Fränkisch</strong></h4><p><span>The dialect itself is quite round and fluid sounding, not as sharp and nasal as northern dialects. People explained to me that it sounds like there are no hard consonants – think Ds and Bs instead of Ts and Ps. Although it doesn’t score very highly on Germans’ favourite dialects, it tends to land around mid-table, it’s not made fun of in the same way people from Saxony are, for example.</span></p><p><span>Let’s look at some common examples of Fränkisch words and their counterparts in Hochdeutsch (High German, the standard version of the language you learn at <span><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lingoda</a></strong></span>) and English.</span></p><ul><li><span><strong>bsuffm, betrunken</strong> –&nbsp; drunk</span></li><li><span><strong>Weggla, Brötchen</strong> –&nbsp; bread roll</span></li><li><span><strong>Seidla, halber Liter</strong> – a half litre (usually of beer)</span></li><li><span><strong>Schdraßaboh, strassenbahn</strong> – trolley bus or streetcar</span></li><li><span><strong>Maadla, Mädchen</strong> – girl</span></li><li><span><strong>Servus, Hallo</strong> – hello</span></li></ul><h4><strong>Bavarian</strong></h4><p><span>On average, we see Bavarian thrown around a bit more in the rest of Germany because of its connection with <span><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oktoberfest</a></strong></span>. I affectionately refer to the month of September as Bavarian-advertising month because it seems like everywhere from restaurants to grocery stores through in a bit of Bayerisch to make it seem more festive.</span></p><p><span>A jolly sounding dialect, Bavarian is very different to Frankish, despite being spoken in close proximity for hundreds of years. You can also hear Bavarian throughout Austria, and into some parts of Switzerland too. Let’s compare some Bavarian dialect words.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bigstock-Neuschwanstein-Castle-In-Munic-320918383.jpg alt="andscape with Neuschwanstein castle taken from above.
