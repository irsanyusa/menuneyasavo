Her real surname is&nbsp;Mitchell.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aba/a72/b4fd5750a7a16bc392809fe056.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was recently revealed that Julia Roberts didn’t get the surname “Roberts” biologically. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>This information</a> came to&nbsp;light after a&nbsp;TV show conducted research into Roberts’ family history. They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discovered</a> that her great-great-grandmother had married a&nbsp;man named Willis R. Roberts, but he&nbsp;died more than a&nbsp;decade before her great-grandfather, John, was born.</p><p>Additionally, a&nbsp;DNA test conducted on&nbsp;Roberts and her cousin showed that they were both related to&nbsp;an&nbsp;ancestor named Henry McDonald Mitchell&nbsp;Jr., which means that the actress is&nbsp;actually biologically a&nbsp;Mitchell, not a&nbsp;Roberts. Her real name would have been Julia Mitchell.</p><p><h2>2. Her stepfather didn’t treat her well.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d3b/292/c3108e53df859e3e2f92a093d4.jpg><p>Julia Roberts’ parents were both passionate about the performing arts, but their marriage ended when she was only 4&nbsp;years old. Her mother’s new husband <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>proved to&nbsp;be</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;difficult figure in&nbsp;Roberts’ life. He&nbsp;was rough with her and her siblings, but her mother eventually divorced him before Roberts graduated high school.</p><p><h2>3. Her biological father passed away.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f13/1a4/16954954d084972b4699afdc1f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;her issues with her stepfather, when Roberts was just 10&nbsp;years old, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lost her biological father</a> to&nbsp;throat cancer. At&nbsp;a&nbsp;young age, she had to&nbsp;endure many difficult experiences.</p><p><h2>4. She was a&nbsp;model at&nbsp;the very beginning of&nbsp;her career.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8d9/f70/f8f58e539b9b1fc814f32bbb23.jpg><p>Despite the hardships she faced in&nbsp;her <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a>, Roberts still managed to&nbsp;pursue her passions. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager, she was part of&nbsp;the school band and had aspirations of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;veterinarian. However, after graduating high school in&nbsp;1985, her plans took a&nbsp;different direction. She moved to&nbsp;New York City, signed with a&nbsp;modeling agency, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> taking acting classes.</p><p><h2>5. She had a&nbsp;passionate romance with Liam Neeson.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/023/d1c/5bf0d8570b9d01dd83a86814d4.jpg><p>IFA Film / East News</p><p>At&nbsp;one point in&nbsp;time, Julia Roberts and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Liam Neeson</a> had a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>romantic relationship</a>. However, their relationship was met with controversy due to&nbsp;the large age gap between them, with Roberts being 19&nbsp;and Neeson being 35. Nevertheless, despite that fact, they moved in&nbsp;together, but their romance was short-lived and ended after a&nbsp;year.</p><p><h2>6. Her breakout role was in&nbsp;<i>Mystic Pizza</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/89d/4ed/8d01dc5e04b84a4bcdd47e3658.png><p>Many people consider Roberts’ most iconic role to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the romantic comedy, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Pretty Woman</i></a>, which helped establish her as&nbsp;a&nbsp;household name. However, her breakout role was actually in&nbsp;the coming-of-age film,<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i> Mystic Pizza</i></a>, which was released in&nbsp;1988.</p><p>Roberts knew she had made it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;star when a&nbsp;fan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>approached her</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;public restroom and asked if&nbsp;she had been in&nbsp;<i>Mystic Pizza</i>, and after she confirmed&nbsp;it, the fan asked for her autograph, sliding a&nbsp;napkin under the door.</p><p><h2>7. She had a&nbsp;hard time behind the scenes of&nbsp;<i>Steel Magnolias</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/16f/ba3/3680bb5c4c8f8462ed9be3721e.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Steel Magnolias</i></a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;drama flick that is&nbsp;remembered by&nbsp;many as&nbsp;a&nbsp;tear-jerker about southern women from different backgrounds. However, the behind-the-scenes experience for the cast was not as&nbsp;positive. Actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Shirley MacLaine</a> has shared that the director of&nbsp;the film <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was particularly harsh</a> toward Roberts, criticizing her acting and even suggesting she cut off the mole she had under her eye.</p><p><h2>8. She had an&nbsp;affair with her married co-star, Kiefer Sutherland.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b29/808/0efec75864b9dfaba132406f30.jpg><p>After her relationship with <a href=# title="Liam Neeson" data-link=tag>Liam Neeson</a>, Roberts <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>moved on</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;co-star <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Dylan Mcdermott </a>during the filming of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Steel Magnolias</i></a>. However, she soon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>began dating </a>another co-star, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Kiefer Sutherland</a>. The relationship was complicated, as&nbsp;Sutherland was already married with a&nbsp;young child at&nbsp;the time, but he&nbsp;separated from his wife and began dating Roberts.</p><p>Unfortunately, Sutherland ended up&nbsp;having an&nbsp;affair with another woman who sold the story to&nbsp;the press and spoke poorly of&nbsp;Roberts. Surprisingly, despite all the drama, Roberts and Sutherland got engaged afterward.</p><p><h2>9. She actually was a&nbsp;real “runaway bride.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c77/5c1/7ffc3f5468beee95d3d8708307.jpg><p>In&nbsp;real life, Roberts’ story mirrored that of&nbsp;the character she played in&nbsp;the movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Runaway Bride</i></a>. She had made arrangements for a&nbsp;big wedding. The ceremony was set to&nbsp;take place just a&nbsp;month after the engagement. However, 3&nbsp;days before the wedding, Roberts <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>called it&nbsp;off</a> and left for Ireland with her friend, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jason Patric</a>, who was also best friends with her then-fiancé, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Kiefer Sutherland</a>.</p><p><h2>10. She had a&nbsp;lifelong feud with director Steven Spielberg.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/79e/c16/3bd2735894ab5e8c7c81716f27.jpg><p>Working on&nbsp;the movie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Hook</i></a><i> </i>with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Steven Spielberg</a> caused a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bitter quarrel</a> between the actress and the director, and the 2&nbsp;never worked together again. According to&nbsp;Spielberg, Roberts was difficult to&nbsp;work with, refusing to&nbsp;leave her trailer for hours and proving to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hard on&nbsp;the crew. However, according to&nbsp;Roberts, it&nbsp;was Spielberg who was the nightmare to&nbsp;work with, and the 2&nbsp;haven’t resolved their dispute until today.</p><p><h2>11. She sided with her brother’s ex-wife in&nbsp;a&nbsp;custody battle for her niece.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/abc/51a/92e35151abadebdcb0c6602190.jpg><p>Typically, family members tend to&nbsp;support each other, but Julia Roberts made it&nbsp;clear where her morals stood in&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular situation involving her brother. When her brother and his wife separated and went through a&nbsp;custody battle for their daughter, Roberts <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>paid</a> for her brother’s ex-wife’s legal representation. This suggests that her brother’s actions were particularly egregious.</p><p>What’s your favorite Julia Roberts movie?
