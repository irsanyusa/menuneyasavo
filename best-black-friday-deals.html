The sales normally run through to the end of Monday, November 27 (Cyber Monday). Of course, you can skip all those lines by doing all your shopping online, especially since so many brands have started well in advance with <a rel=alternate href=#>early Black Friday deals</a>.</p><h3>What deals should I expect on Black Friday?</h3><p>The easier question to answer would be, what isn’t on sale on Black Friday? Virtually every category out there—fashion, beauty, tech, home goods, travel, pets, etc.—will have some kind of deal on, whether it’s two for one deals or bundles or, more commonly, steep discounts on their regular prices.</p><h3>What kind of Black Friday deals did they have last year?</h3><p>Again, most brands participate in some form, so last year saw the likes of Amazon, Target, Walmart, Apple, Dyson, Costco, Home Depot, JCPenney, Lowe’s, Macy’s, and many, many others offer huge markdowns on selected products.</p><h3>How to get a good deal on Black Friday</h3><p>If you go in without a plan, you’re likely to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of offers, and end up with something you weren’t necessarily needing. To prevent this, make a list—ideally in priority order—of all the stuff you’ve been holding off buying at full price. In the two weeks leading up to Black Friday, check all the relevant sites to see what announcements they’re making. Sign up for emails, set up Google alerts, and follow relevant brands on social media to be sure you’re not missing anything.</p><h3>How to choose the best Black Friday deals for you</h3><h4>Shop around</h4><p>You never know which store will have your coveted item at the lowest price, so be sure to do some comparison shopping.</p><h4>Do your research</h4><p>Double check that the item you’ve had your eye on is really the best pick for you—it could well be that a better, higher-end model is now on sale for a good price.</p><h4>Triple-check your budget</h4><p>It can be easy to go into a spending frenzy when faced with so many deals, so it’s good to make a budget plan of what you’re willing to spend (and a list of what you need), and stick to it.</p><h3>Where to find Black Friday deals</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, most brands participate in Black Friday in some way, so make a list of your favorite stores and check in on them—online or in person—in the weeks beforehand, to see what announcements they’re making.</p><h3>What is a Black Friday sale?</h3><p>Black Friday sales are short periods in which many goods are offered at steep discounts, running from midnight on the Friday after Thanksgiving (Black Friday) through to the end of the following Monday (Cyber Monday).</p><h3>Why is it called Black Friday?</h3><p>As with other so-called “Black” days (such as the stock market disasters of Black Tuesday and, decades later, Black Monday), Black Friday started out as a pretty bad day. The colloquial term given to the day after Thanksgiving by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Philadelphia police</a>, due to the long hours they’d have to work controlling the crowds for that weekend’s Army-Navy football game, it was later adopted by stores in the area, who’d use it as a way to entice in all the tourist foot traffic.</p><p>Since attempts to change the name to the more positive-sounding “Big Friday” failed, the term was later retconned to imply that this was the day when many stores would go from being “in the red” to “in the black.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lkqGupLeMn6minJGueqWxwKWqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
