Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley each dabbled in Hollywood, while others like Dolly Parton, Barbra Streisand, Cher and Madonna all made jumps of their own throughout the last half century.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Today, it’s become the expectation that major artists will try their hands at acting. And Hollywood — always in search of big-name talent to boost the profiles of its projects —&nbsp;has been more than happy to oblige. A new Morning Consult survey found that, among a list of 36 of pop stars, rockers and rappers who also act, Americans selected Lady Gaga and Jennifer Lopez as the two who have made the transition the best.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The survey also asked Americans how they perceive each of these musicians-turned-actors, finding that for nearly all of them —&nbsp;including those who have mostly stopped making new music or performing on stage and act more than they sing —&nbsp;the public still considers them to be musicians first.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Musicians are always musicians</strong><strong><br></strong></h2><ul class="mb-m ml-m text-body-large"><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Taylor Swift (47%), Billie Eilish (43%), Rihanna (39%), The Weeknd (35%) and Lenny Kravitz (29%) were the figures whom respondents most perceived as “only musicians.” Swift made appearances in the films “Cats” and “Amsterdam,” and Rihanna co-starred in “Ocean’s 8,” while Kravitz had a supporting role in “The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.”</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">The celebrities whom the most respondents considered to be primarily actors who sometimes do music were Queen Latifah (31%), Ice T (28%), Lopez (27%), Ice Cube (23%), LL Cool J (22%) and Mandy Moore (22%). Moore, one of the stars of NBC’s “This Is Us,” was the only figure whom more Americans said was an “actor who sometimes performs music” than a “musician who sometimes acts.”</li></ul><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The musician-to-actor pipeline</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">It’s clear that Americans want to see their favorite musicians act in films and TV shows. About two-thirds (67%) of the general public said they at least “somewhat” enjoy seeing musicians act, with 21% saying they enjoy it “a lot.” About 1 in 4 (23%) said they prefer to see <i>more </i>musicians make the transition to acting.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Those Americans are getting their wish.
