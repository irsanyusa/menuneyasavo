J.J. Redick — $23.0 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Philadelphia 76ers</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Shooting Guard</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Redick is entering his 12th NBA season and in his first 11 seasons, he never made more than $7.4 million in any one season. This season he will make more than the next two highest-paid players on the 76ers combined, Amir Johnson and Jerryd Bayless, who will make $20.0 million combined.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>t25. Harrison Barnes — $23.1 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Dallas Mavericks</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Small Forward</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>t25. Chandler Parsons — $23.1 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Memphis Grizzlies</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Small Forward</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Health is the biggest concern with Parsons.

Dwight Howard — $23.5 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Charlotte Hornets</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Center</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Dwight Howard is playing for his fifth team in seven years. Howard's one season with the Atlanta Hawks was one of his better seasons since being traded away from the Orlando Magic in 2012. The 8-time All-Star averaged 13.5 points and 12.7 rebounds per game during the regular season.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>t20. Andre Drummond — $23.8 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Detroit Pistons</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Center</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Entering the 2017-18 season, Drummond had made 683 free throws in his career. He had missed 1,110. This season, however, he is up to a respectable 63%.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>t20. Anthony Davis — $23.8 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: New Orleans Pelicans</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Power Forward</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Davis likely lost out on an additional $23 million from "The Derrick Rose Rule" by missing 21 games during the 2015-16 season. Davis was not named to an All-NBA team which <a href=# id=0ea121b8-f0eb-5e16-beb9-e47ce3656145>kept the Rose provision from kicking in</a>. This season he has upped his game and is getting some MVP consideration.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>t20. Bradley Beal — $23.8 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Washington Wizards</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Shooting Guard</p><p><strong>Contract</strong>: 5 years, $127.2 million</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Staying healthy is the key to Beal's contract. The 2016-17 season was just the second time he played more than 63 games in a season. But in staying healthy, he posted career highs of 23.1 points per game and 20.1 PER.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>t20. Hassan Whiteside — $23.8 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Miami Heat</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Center</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Whiteside played in just 19 games in the first four seasons after being drafted by the Sacramento Kings in 2010. However, since landing in Miami he has developed into one of the best defensive big men in the NBA, leading the league in rebounds this past season and in blocks two seasons ago.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>19. C.J. McCollum — $24 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Portland Trail Blazers</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Shooting Guard</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: McCollum was rewarded with a max-level extension after just one season as a starter. He then rewarded the Trail Blazers for the generosity by continuing to improve in his fourth season, pushing his average up to 23.0 points per game. He also had a career high 19.9 PER last season.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>18. Chris Paul — $24.3 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Houston Rockets</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Paul shocked the NBA by agreeing to a trade to the Rockets to team with James Harden and form one of the most compelling backcourts in the league. It didn't take long for the two to figure things out as the Rockets are seen as a legit threat to the Warriors in the West.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>17. Otto Porter Jr. — $24.8 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Washington Wizards</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Small Forward</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>16. Jrue Holiday — $24.9 million</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Holiday may have been one of the luckiest players in the NBA in recent seasons. After the Pelicans traded for Demarcus Cousins, they couldn't afford to let their point guard walk in free agency without a viable replacement. That gave Holiday all the leverage he needed for a max contract.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>15. Kevin Durant — $25 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Golden State Warriors</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Small Forward</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>14. Andrew Wiggins — $25.3 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Minnesota Timberwolves</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Small Forward</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Since Wiggins was traded by the Cavs to the T-Wolves as part of the deal for Kevin Love, he matured into a 24-point-per-game scorer during the 2016-17 season. However, his scoring is down to 18 points per game this season.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>13. Damian Lillard — $26.2 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Portland Trail Blazers</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Lillard's contract jumped in value by about $15 million thanks to "The Derrick Rose Rule," a rule that allowed younger star players to earn more money if they met certain criteria. Lillard qualified by twice making the All-NBA team.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>12. Carmelo Anthony — $26.2 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Oklahoma City Thunder</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Small Forward</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: The Thunder were supposed to be the classic example of the small-market team that couldn't keep its stars. Instead, it put on a <a href=# id=34e132ba-d10d-5c02-86cf-bb0295d63dca>master-class in super-team building</a>, including the surprise trade for Anthony.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>11. Al Horford — $27.7 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Boston Celtics</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Center</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: With the Celtics adding Kyrie Irving and the now-injured Gordon Hayward this offseason, it was easy to forget that the first big piece to the team's rebuild was a max contract for Horford.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>10. DeMar DeRozan — $27.7 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Toronto Raptors</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Shooting Guard</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: DeRozan's deal was the second-largest in NBA history when it was signed in 2016.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>9. James Harden — $28.3 million</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Shooting Guard</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Harden still has another season left on his current contract before his 4-year, $169.3 million extension kicks in. His salary in the first season of that deal will be $37.8 million and it will eventually grow to $46.9 million.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>t7. Russell Westbrook — $28.5 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Oklahoma City Thunder</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>t7. Mike Conley — $28.5 million</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Conley's contract was the richest in NBA history when it was signed during the 2016 free agency period.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>6. Kyle Lowry — $28.7 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Toronto Raptors</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: <a href=# id=329e875c-1c6c-5b7d-847b-c7efb7b34aae>Lowry can earn up to $2 million in bonuses</a>. But to get them all, he would need to make the All-Star game, be named All-NBA and All-Defense, and have the Raptors win the championship. On top of that, he would also need to play in at least 65 games and average at least 25 minutes per game.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>5. Blake Griffin — $29.5 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Los Angeles Clippers</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Power Forward</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Part of the Clippers' pitch to re-sign Griffin included <a href=# id=a8c0add9-0968-514c-ae23-7f86a45ef9bb>t-shirts that compared Griffin to numerous historical figures</a>, including Muhammad Ali, President John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr, Nelson Mandela, Abraham Lincoln, President Barack Obama, Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, and even Michael Jackson.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>4. Gordon Hayward — $29.7 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Boston Celtics</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Small Forward</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: In one of the biggest moves of free agency, the new-look Celtics signed Hayward and will team him with Kyrie Irving. Doc Rivers called it <a href=# id=cd108829-f277-5c33-bedb-1c748a17a81f>the best rebuild "maybe ever."</a> Unfortunately, <a href=# id=b2db8efb-5cf9-5834-b8d7-8f4e739adff9>Hayward broke his ankle</a> just minutes into his first game with the Celtics.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>3.

LeBron James — $33.3 million</p><p><strong>Team</strong>: Cleveland Cavaliers</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Small Forward</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: LeBron is in his 15th season, and after two years of one-year contracts in his return to the Cavs, he finally started to cash-in big time the last two seasons. Either way, we shouldn't worry about LeBron, he is still <a href=# id=7cf6427f-b6ce-5a25-88de-e5e4e5801ca0>one of the most frugal players in the NBA</a>.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>1. Stephen Curry — $34.7 million</p><p><strong>Position</strong>: Point Guard</p><p><strong>One thing to know</strong>: Curry's $201 million contract was the largest in NBA history at the time of its signing, a huge pay bump from what was the biggest bargain in the NBA. Warriors owner Joe Lacob apparently wanted to try to get another bargain out of Curry as <a href=# id=85023733-8bec-5062-a032-7b8b445daa13>Lacob had to be talked out of offering Curry something below the max</a>. Instead, Curry is the NBA's newest highest-paid player, replacing LeBron James.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Now check out the players who have made the most in NBA history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70qmmq6yjZMCxu9GtqmasmJp6c4OMoaCgoJWowW68wKKbZqiclsamvtJmoKdlpJ2ybrrBmmSfp6JiwamxjGtnam9dZoVuv8SaqqimX6Oxd73Nr20%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
