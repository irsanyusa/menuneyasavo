The legacy of Scottish slave traders can be seen in the bequest of buildings now used as museums, council buildings, schools, houses – some still associated with past owners. Many of these are visitor attractions and are now looked after by the National Trust for Scotland, which is working to publish the histories of their properties and how slave-ownership and colonialism contributed to Scotland’s history.</p><p>Sir Geoff uses his prominence in Scotland as both a respected scientist and ardent activist to talk about the history of slavery and its benefits in the 17th and 18th centuries for prominent Scots in the trade. Many of the names seen around Scotland, (especially in Edinburgh and Glasgow) and elsewhere in the Highlands and Lowlands, are figures who made a huge contribution to the wealth and prosperity of Scottish communities off the back of chattel slavery in the West Indies.</p><p>Slavery was lucrative for Scotland and the UK. By 1800 there were 800,000 UK owned, African-born slaves, of which over 300,000 were in Jamaica, generating a disproportionately high level of the profits. However, Sir Geoff’s view is that the history of the slave trade isn’t well-known or understood in the UK and teaching about this history will help people to understand personal and societal biases on the grounds of colour or race. This will enable us to tell a richer story of our history and celebrate our diverse society as “One Scotland”.</p><p>At present there are limited resources and few relevant books on the topic. There are history books but not designed to link Scotland’s history with education on slavery in schools; in fact, the topic is still hotly debated. This historical topic is very unfamiliar in Scotland and has never been a major part of the school curriculum. There are positive steps being taken though, such as the proposal for the development of a National Museum of Human Rights in Greenock, a location that was once Scotland’s premier sugar port. The Slavery and Colonialism projects being conducted by Edinburgh City Council and Museums Scotland, which are chaired by Sir Geoff, may hopefully help to develop education in schools.</p><p>Sir Geoff has spoken about the importance of making equality a value that is reflected across all aspects of an organisation. He has identified that we shouldn’t just create an equality policy and make it the role of one person in an organisation to uphold – equality needs to be a statement of any organisation’s values and outcomes as a whole, backed up by awareness and the meeting of needs. The input and advice from minority ethnic colleagues and communities are important parts of this commitment. Sir Geoff has stated that, a diverse society needs diverse management to be fair and efficient.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjqKlrKiZp661tc6nZqyhomK0prvFn2SpmZyisrM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
