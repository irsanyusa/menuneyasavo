But at&nbsp;some point, their interest in&nbsp;makeup may seem too grown-up of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pastime and even concerning for some parents.</p><p>On&nbsp;the one hand, there are people who think there’s no&nbsp;harm in&nbsp;letting a&nbsp;child wear a&nbsp;little blush while at&nbsp;home or&nbsp;some lip gloss while going to&nbsp;the grocery store. Some say, “It’s just for fun. It&nbsp;makes my&nbsp;child happy and doesn’t really hurt anyone.” Others, however, believe that letting kids use <a href=# title=cosmetics data-link=tag>cosmetics</a> might send a&nbsp;negative message about their self-esteem and put too much emphasis on&nbsp;outer beauty at&nbsp;an&nbsp;early age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/447/48c/3f543452daa1e921237e8e9caa.jpg><p>Surprisingly, when celebrities allow their not-so-grown-up kids to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;makeup, public opinion often stays on&nbsp;the very positive side.</p><p>Taking to&nbsp;Instagram this year, Hilaria Baldwin <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>posted</a> a&nbsp;“back to&nbsp;school” image carousel featuring some of&nbsp;her children. In&nbsp;them, people could see her 9-year-old daughter, Carmen, wearing dark burgundy lipstick for her first day of&nbsp;fourth grade, and fans absolutely praised the young girl for being an&nbsp;“icon.” The post has since racked up&nbsp;over 24,000 likes and got even more supportive comments.</p><p><h2>The opinions of&nbsp;psychologists are surprisingly positive too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66c/05b/087e7757a8afa1564f3a59c824.jpg><p>Dr. Tamar Kahane, a&nbsp;child and adolescent psychologist, shares her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opinion</a> on&nbsp;the reasons why a&nbsp;kid may actually want to&nbsp;wear makeup, even at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very early age. One such reason was their desire to&nbsp;communicate in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special way. Dr. Kahane says, “One of&nbsp;the ways in&nbsp;which a&nbsp;child learns about their world is&nbsp;through dressing&nbsp;up. They take on&nbsp;different roles through their play, and that’s <strong>how they communicate</strong>.”</p><p>But the most surprising reason, according to&nbsp;the psychologist, is&nbsp;the child thinking, “<strong>I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;look like or&nbsp;be&nbsp;like Mommy. I&nbsp;see Mommy puts on&nbsp;makeup, so&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;also</strong>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f5a/65e/4e3e305a4d88a91428ef380fad.jpg><p>While some parents are concerned that makeup may be&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-esteem issue for their kids, specialists claim otherwise. Pediatrician Eva Kubiczek-Love, M.D., <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “It’s always a&nbsp;good idea to&nbsp;ask your kids why they’re interested in&nbsp;makeup, encourage them to&nbsp;have fun, and expect that you may need to&nbsp;tell them when you think too much is&nbsp;too much.”</p><p>Dr. Tamar Kahane suggests that parents should not overthink things when their kids express an&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;makeup. Instead, psychologists suggest giving the kids a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;try things within limits. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “I&nbsp;agree that little girls shouldn’t be&nbsp;running around wearing makeup outside the house. But I&nbsp;think we&nbsp;should start by&nbsp;understanding and acknowledging that they like to&nbsp;wear makeup and giving them a&nbsp;time and a&nbsp;place and a&nbsp;space to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that.”</p><p><h2>The proper age to&nbsp;wear makeup doesn’t actually exist.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/daa/0ae/20387a5e21aa90e811a8a0d740.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;Alan E. Kazdin, Sterling Professor of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Psychology data-link=tag>Psychology</a> and Professor of&nbsp;Child Psychiatry at&nbsp;Yale University, there is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>no&nbsp;certain age</a> at&nbsp;which a&nbsp;child should or&nbsp;should not wear makeup. “There are several factors that dictate when a&nbsp;child begins to&nbsp;wear makeup, including a&nbsp;culture, a&nbsp;parent’s socioeconomic status, a&nbsp;child’s peers&nbsp;— it’s multi-determined,” says Kazdin. “There’s no&nbsp;age that you can say, ’Okay, buy them everything.’”</p><p>This thought is&nbsp;supported by&nbsp;Erick Kenneth French, a&nbsp;licensed clinical social worker. He&nbsp;says that “wearing makeup can mean different things in&nbsp;different cultures,” and it’s not necessarily all about selfies and Sephora. For example, in&nbsp;some cultures, eyeliner is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;protect kids’ eyes from the sun.</p><p>French says, “The most important thing to&nbsp;consider when sharing any activity with your children is&nbsp;what you’re being and <strong>what you’re teaching them to&nbsp;be</strong>&nbsp;when they engage in&nbsp;the activity. In&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;makeup, your child’s experience of&nbsp;<strong>what you are being when you wear makeup yourself </strong>will strongly impact what it&nbsp;means to&nbsp;wear makeup for themselves.”</p><p>What is&nbsp;your attitude about kids wearing makeup? What is&nbsp;the right age to&nbsp;start using cosmetics, in&nbsp;your opinion? When did you start using&nbsp;it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYyiq6xll6S8pXnFqKlmo5mZwG7AzmaunpmiYrqit8Sup2aZnpl6uLTArWSan5VitrS602arqKddmq6zuNhmmJybn6exqrrGZquoZaCoxqS0zqWmoKGjqcBuhI9ybHJvXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
