Add in the fact that workers in Scotland enjoy an excellent work-life balance and short commuting times and you have everything you need to start, or kick-start your career.</p><p>We also know that moving to a new country is a pretty big deal and there are lots of different things to think about before you make the big move. Luckily, we’ve got you covered and have put together a handy list of things you should consider before making your move.</p><h3><strong>1. Can you work in Scotland?</strong></h3><p>Scotland is renowned for its warm and friendly welcome, which we extend to people from all around the world. With the right skills – and, in some cases, the right visa – you can join them.</p><p>If you’re thinking of joining us from within the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, the good news is that you don’t need a visa to live and work in Scotland.</p><p>If you’re thinking of joining us from outside the EEA, you will need to get a visa. We have a range of different visas depending on your individual circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p><a class="btn-icon btn-icon--icon-left btn-icon--icon-external" href=#>Find out if you can work in Scotland&nbsp;on TalentScotland.com</a>.</p><h3><strong>2. What are the benefits of working in Scotland?</strong></h3><p>Let’s start with your holiday entitlement, because we all know that all work and no play is boring – not to mention bad for you. Thankfully, all your hard work in Scotland is rewarded with a generous amount of paid time off from your job!</p><p>These holidays – known as annual leave – are calculated according to the number of days you work. If you work full-time, five days a week, you’re normally entitled to at least 28 days of paid holiday a year, though some companies offer even more.</p><p>As well as amazing holiday benefits, many people who come to Scotland to work say that the great work-life balance is one of the best things about working here.</p><p>Gabriel West, an American working for the Amazon Development Centre in Edinburgh, said:</p><p>“I’ve been very impressed by how people have this relaxed idea – a modern idea - about how much time should be spent at work and how much time should be spent doing home life things”.</p><p>Scotland also has highly regulated, good working practices and conditions to safeguard employees, high staff retention rates and the highest employment rate of the UK’s four countries.</p><h3><strong>3. What companies are in Scotland?</strong></h3><p>The good news is that you’re not the only one who thinks coming to Scotland for work is a good idea. Whether it is global giants like Amazon, Morgan Stanley and Hewlett Packard, or home-grown success stories like Skyscanner, pureLifi and 4J Studios, we are home to thousands of innovative companies for you to choose from.</p><p>Whether you’re looking for a role with a Fortune 500 company or want to get in on the ground-floor with a small start-up, you’ll be spoilt for choice.</p><p><a class="btn-icon btn-icon--icon-left btn-icon--icon-external" href=#>Search an A-Z list of&nbsp;many employers in Scotland on TalentScotland.com</a></p><h3><strong>4. How can you find job opportunities?</strong></h3><p>Because there’s such a diverse range of companies in Scotland, there are a lot of great job opportunities.
