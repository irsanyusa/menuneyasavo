Her striking features and poise made her a&nbsp;sought-after subject of&nbsp;photographs and paintings in&nbsp;the late 19th century. Her beauty was celebrated not only in&nbsp;Iran but also in&nbsp;Europe, where she became known as&nbsp;the “Persian Venus.”</p><p><h2>The 1900s<br>Ethel Barrymore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/186/788/6368b656f08fdfee1d8b71f9d2.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Ethel Barrymore</a>, an&nbsp;actress born in&nbsp;1879, was a&nbsp;notable beauty in&nbsp;her time and the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first</a> woman to&nbsp;be&nbsp;called a&nbsp;“glamour girl.” Barrymore was considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the most regal female presence on&nbsp;the American stage for the first half of&nbsp;the 20th century.<br></p><p><h2>The 1910s<br>Camille Clifford</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f49/6b7/79a91b52668b92da37c1432edc.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the last century, the hourglass figure was the ideal of&nbsp;female beauty. At&nbsp;that time, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Gibson</a>, an&nbsp;illustrator for popular magazines, was looking for the ideal woman whose looks he&nbsp;could use in&nbsp;his postcards. And he&nbsp;found actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Camille Clifford</a>. Her figure, with her tiny 18-inch waist, became the standard of&nbsp;female beauty.</p><p>Her images and photographs were widely used in&nbsp;<a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> magazines, and women tried to&nbsp;imitate her by&nbsp;wearing uncomfortable <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>corsets</a>. The career of&nbsp;the actress was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>short-lived</a>, but she is&nbsp;forever immortalized in&nbsp;Gibson postcards and this trend also changed <a href=#>women’s anatomy</a>.</p><p><h2>The 1920s<br>Josephine Baker and Coco Chanel</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b45/25e/59fce052de9b4294119c5ebb8c.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 1920s, the fashion for curves gradually began to&nbsp;fade away. Women adopted a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>freer</a> style: they began to&nbsp;wear short haircuts and bright makeup, and chose unusual outfits. The ideal of&nbsp;this time was the dancer, actress, and singer Josephine Baker, the illegitimate daughter of&nbsp;a&nbsp;musician and laundress. From the age of&nbsp;13, she made a&nbsp;living by&nbsp;street dancing and gradually became very popular. Her exotic appearance and fluid movements captivated audiences, and she was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dubbed</a> the Black Venus.</p><p>Baker’s dancing had elements of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hip hop</a>, which much later developed into an&nbsp;independent style. Ernest Hemingway called her “the most sensational woman anyone ever saw.” Picasso drew paintings of&nbsp;her. The actress was friends with Grace Kelly, who helped her with money. Josephine adopted 12&nbsp;children of&nbsp;different races and continued to&nbsp;perform on&nbsp;stage until her death at&nbsp;68&nbsp;years old.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/337/155/9c21d358d091d4dfcb8bd4fde3.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Coco Chanel</a> was a&nbsp;highly influential designer in&nbsp;the 1920s and beyond, and her fashion innovations revolutionized the way women dressed. She was known for her simple, elegant designs emphasizing comfort and practicality.</p><p>Chanel’s designs were in&nbsp;stark contrast to&nbsp;the restrictive and elaborate clothing styles that were popular during the 19th century and early 20th century. She popularized looser-fitting clothes that allowed women to&nbsp;move more freely and comfortably. She also incorporated masculine elements into her designs, like tweed fabrics and sailor-inspired tops, which helped to&nbsp;create the androgynous look that was popular in&nbsp;the 1920s.</p><p>One of&nbsp;her most significant contributions to&nbsp;fashion was the introduction of&nbsp;the “little black dress,” which became a&nbsp;staple in&nbsp;women’s wardrobes and is&nbsp;still popular today.</p><p><h2>The 1930s<br>Greta Garbo</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/54a/89f/371a3351c9b0096cc0922a7864.jpg><p>Mary Evans / AF Archive / East News<span>, </span>Courtesy Everett Collection / East News</p><p>After the wild <a href=# title=freedom data-link=tag>freedom</a> of&nbsp;the ’20s, the following decade was marked by&nbsp;a&nbsp;softer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>feminine</a> style. The ideal of&nbsp;beauty of&nbsp;that time was Greta Garbo, known for playing tragic characters, due to&nbsp;which she was believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;melancholic and even gloomy person. Her high arched eyebrows, pale flawless skin, and languid gaze still fascinate many people to&nbsp;this day. Critics and historians have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> about her, “Of&nbsp;all the stars who have ever fired the imaginations of&nbsp;audiences, none has quite projected a&nbsp;magnetism and a&nbsp;mystique equal to&nbsp;Garbo.”</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Naysayers</a> didn’t believe that a&nbsp;successful silent film actress could work in&nbsp;sound. But Garbo’s first sound film brought her an&nbsp;Oscar nomination. After that, the actress became famous all over the world, which increased the attention she got from the media, making her feel uncomfortable. She never married, had no&nbsp;children, stopped acting in&nbsp;films at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;35, and confessed to&nbsp;her biographer: “I&nbsp;was tired of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>. I&nbsp;really wanted to&nbsp;live another life.”</p><p><h2>The 1940s<br>Rita Hayworth</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/187/5c2/9f43e5563b8bd44e55aee8d57d.jpg><p>Courtesy Everett Collection / East News<span>, </span>Columbia Pictures Corporation / Collection Christophel / East News</p><p>In&nbsp;this decade, the silhouette of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman wearing a&nbsp;suit, either with a&nbsp;skirt or&nbsp;with trousers, became <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>popular</a>. Moreover, the length of&nbsp;the skirt became shorter and ended just below the knee. In&nbsp;the late 1940s, Dior released the New Look collection with puffy skirts and tight jackets, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>eyebrows</a> became a&nbsp;little wider and more natural-looking. Rita Hayworth, the beauty icon of&nbsp;that time who was coined by&nbsp;the press as&nbsp;“The Love <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Goddess</a>,” had eyebrows that followed this trend.</p><p>But at&nbsp;the dawn of&nbsp;her career, she was rarely given parts in&nbsp;movies because her last name was Cansino, and she had a&nbsp;Mediterranean appearance. So, the actress had to&nbsp;change her name to&nbsp;Hayworth, dye her hair red, and have electrolysis to&nbsp;raise her hairline. Hayworth confessed that she was the complete opposite of&nbsp;the bright and seductive heroines she played. It’s hard to&nbsp;believe that the iconic hair flip scene shown in&nbsp;<i>The Shawshank Redemption</i> was performed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shy</a> and insecure girl.</p><p><h2>The 1950s<br>Brigitte Bardot and Audrey Hepburn</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/886/cc2/11bba45fa1b89486573cba7c81.jpg><p>Everett Collection / East News</p><p>In&nbsp;the 1950s, a&nbsp;curvy hourglass figure <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>became</a> trendy again. The first breast <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>augmentation</a> surgeries began to&nbsp;gain popularity. Brigitte Bardot became the new beauty icon along with the sensual actress <a href=# title="Marilyn Monroe" data-link=tag>Marilyn Monroe</a>. In&nbsp;1956, the movie <i>And God Created Woman</i> was released, which made 22-year-old Bardot a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;emancipation, boldness, and freedom. It’s interesting that, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, she had to&nbsp;follow strict behavioral <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>standards</a>.</p><p>All this instilled a&nbsp;rebellious spirit in&nbsp;her, which she reflected in&nbsp;her bright roles. Her hairstyle in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comedy</a> <i>Babette Goes to&nbsp;War</i> was wildly popular and was named after the main character. Eyeliner wings, ballet flats, and carefree summer dresses, all these elements of&nbsp;style are still relevant. Even now, the actress stands her ground and forbids anyone from making a&nbsp;biopic about her life, saying, “Wait until I’m dead before you make a&nbsp;movie about my&nbsp;life. Otherwise, sparks will fly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c6/e09/6b2f7050f0bf797bcb56498d45.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>survey</a> done on&nbsp;2,000&nbsp;adults, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Audrey Hepburn</a> was selected as&nbsp;the ultimate beauty icon, coming in&nbsp;first place, followed by&nbsp;Marilyn Monroe and Grace Kelly.<br>This doesn’t come as&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise, given that Hepburn was known for her exceptional bone structure, elegance, and graceful look.</p><p><h2>The 1960s<br>Sophia Loren</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e5a/36c/2791ad50ada6437e922dc4d993.jpg><p>AF Archive/Mary Evans Picture Library/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;the 1960s, Twiggy’s ultra-<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>slimness</a> came into fashion. However, it&nbsp;was also this decade when the inimitable and sensual <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Sophia Loren</a> became an&nbsp;icon of&nbsp;female beauty. In&nbsp;the mid-60s, her most famous movies <i>Marriage Italian Style</i> and <i>The Fall of&nbsp;the Roman Empire</i> were released.</p><p>It’s hard to&nbsp;believe, but she was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reproached</a> for being an&nbsp;unorthodox beauty. She replied saying, “I’ve never been a&nbsp;beautiful doll. In&nbsp;fact, when I&nbsp;started, people didn’t want to&nbsp;hire me&nbsp;because&nbsp;I wasn’t photogenic. People thought my&nbsp;mouth was too big, they wanted me&nbsp;to&nbsp;make my&nbsp;nose shorter, for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;have straighter teeth.” But Loren remained true to&nbsp;herself and earned the love of&nbsp;the public. Her motto&nbsp;is, “Beauty is&nbsp;not important. You have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;interesting, someone who is&nbsp;different from other people.”</p><p><h2>The 1970s<br>Diana Ross</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2eb/f51/3c3e2a5a729cfca61f8462a36b.jpg><p>The Stephen Bourne Collection / Mary Evans / East News</p><p>The 1970s was the era of&nbsp;disco and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decadence</a>. Flared trousers, voluminous hair, thin eyebrows, glossy lips, and long eyelashes&nbsp;— everything was saturated with the spirit of&nbsp;independence and self-confidence. Singer and Academy Award-nominated <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actress</a> Diana Ross was one of&nbsp;the brightest representatives of&nbsp;this decade, along with <a href=# title=Cher data-link=tag>Cher</a>, Debbie Harry, and Jane Birkin. Ross managed to&nbsp;combine the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother of&nbsp;5&nbsp;and be&nbsp;among the most successful dance artists of&nbsp;all time.</p><p>In&nbsp;the 1980s, she dated Gene Simmons, the bass guitarist for the band <i>Kiss</i>, who used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Cher’s boyfriend right before that. However, their relationship didn’t last long. The singer’s style had a&nbsp;huge impact on&nbsp;<a href=# title="Michael Jackson" data-link=tag>Michael Jackson</a>, <a href=# title=Madonna data-link=tag>Madonna</a>, and Beyoncé, and her songs were covered by&nbsp;<a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lopez</a>, Amy Winehouse, Janet Jackson, and <a href=# title="Lady Gaga" data-link=tag>Lady Gaga</a>.</p><p><h2>The 1980s<br>Madonna</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/204/3d9/1f96845293921be9c4df0525b0.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 1980s, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>athleticism</a> became a&nbsp;new trend. The cult of&nbsp;a&nbsp;fit body was maintained on&nbsp;the runway, in&nbsp;movies, and on&nbsp;TV shows, and embodied by&nbsp;supermodels Linda Evangelista and Elle Macpherson, bodybuilder <a href=# title="Arnold Schwarzenegger" data-link=tag>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, and queen of&nbsp;aerobics <a href=# title="Jane Fonda" data-link=tag>Jane Fonda</a>. Nevertheless, the minds and hearts of&nbsp;people were captured by&nbsp;another queen&nbsp;— the extraordinary and seductive <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Madonna</a> Louise Ciccone. She showed&nbsp;us what careless beauty was and how a&nbsp;woman could look attractive without being too feminine.</p><p>Her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>style</a> consisted of&nbsp;tops, a&nbsp;skirt with capri leggings, fishnet stockings, jewelry, and bleached hair. A&nbsp;role model for many women, Madonna once confessed that she was very lonely when she was a&nbsp;teenager, didn’t use makeup at&nbsp;all, and was an&nbsp;excellent student. Madonna is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;very influential musician. Britney Spears, <a href=# title=Rihanna data-link=tag>Rihanna</a>, and Katy Perry acknowledged Madonna’s influence on&nbsp;their work.</p><p><h2>The 1990s<br>Winona Ryder</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/343/855/eb39675907b43062864e842370.jpg><p>CAP / RFS / Capital Pictures / East News<span>, </span>Mary Evans / AF Archive / Graham Whitby Boot / East News</p><p>The 1990s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>became</a> a&nbsp;transition period from athletic bodies to&nbsp;those with a&nbsp;thinner appearance. Androgynous, grunge style, and a&nbsp;pale complexion rapidly gained popularity. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Winona Ryder</a>’s look became a&nbsp;real embodiment of&nbsp;the outgoing century. She was equally convincing in&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;timid blonde in&nbsp;the film <i>Edward Scissorhands</i>, the vampire’s bride in&nbsp;<i>Bram Stoker’s Dracula</i>, and an&nbsp;android in&nbsp;the sci-fi movie <i>Alien Resurrection</i>. <a href=# title=Winona data-link=tag>Winona</a> could show up&nbsp;in&nbsp;public wearing a&nbsp;jet-black bob or&nbsp;a&nbsp;pixie cut.</p><p>Her half-rocker, half-androgynous <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>look</a> became iconic and continues to&nbsp;inspire&nbsp;us to&nbsp;this day. It’s interesting that Winona was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>teased</a> for her looks by&nbsp;her classmates when she was a&nbsp;child. Her popularity gradually faded toward the end of&nbsp;the decade. The 1999 movie <i>Girl, Interrupted</i> didn’t even return her to&nbsp;her former glory but instead became a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>breakthrough</a> role for a&nbsp;future icon&nbsp;— <a href=# title="Angelina Jolie" data-link=tag>Angelina Jolie</a>, who played a&nbsp;supporting role.</p><p><h2>The 2000s<br>Angelina Jolie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/168/4f2/164069503b9c2e4cb4b485e87a.jpg><p>PARAMOUNT PICTURES / Album/EAST NEWS</p><p>With the beginning of&nbsp;the new century, the popularity of&nbsp;a&nbsp;skinny figure was gradually forgotten.

Everyone started to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>demonstrate</a> their 6-pack and chiseled washboard abs, wearing low-waisted jeans: including Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jennifer Lopez, and many others. But the status of&nbsp;beauty icon was won by&nbsp;the tomb raider herself, Angelina Jolie. For this role, she trained in&nbsp;martial arts and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>boxing</a> for 8&nbsp;months.</p><p>The movie&nbsp;<i>Mr.&nbsp;&&nbsp;Mrs. Smith</i> became the final step in&nbsp;reinforcing the image of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman who can stand up&nbsp;for herself.
