Their daughter’s school has contacted him multiple times regarding the fees for the 2021/2022 school term and January 2023, with no response.</p><p>"Legal counsel was sought in February 2023, resulting in David's father, Mr Adedeji Adeleke, eventually paying the outstanding fees. Regardless of this neglect Sophia strongly maintains that the most important support David can provide to their daughter is his presence and emotional support," the statement added.</p><p>She disclosed that every attempt to establish a formal co-parenting arrangement with Davido has been futile, as his lawyers consistently refused to cooperate toward a mutually agreeable resolution, instead resorting to isolating her <a href=# id=31978e50-8369-4766-9b20-0457f0f37644 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>using the artiste's social influence</a> and network.</p><p>Momodu stressed that she has never denied Davido access to their daughter, claiming only access to her body and intimacy, which he has taken issues with.</p><p>"David is in a publicly known relationship, and Sophia wishes him well. She seeks to move forward in her life free from harassment and verbal abuse," the statement concluded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGaipZGZsm6v1KyrqJypYq%2BiwNOlnGarn6W1qq2Mpqamp5SqerOxz6Wgnqtdma63tcOoZqlwoWayq74%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
