The physicist, who died Wednesday at age 76, wasn’t expected to see his 25th birthday, after being diagnosed with the incurable neurodegenerative condition ALS at age 21. Though Hawking beat the odds for more than five decades, the scientist told the Guardian in 2011 that death was never far from his mind.
“I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years,” Hawking said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Though Hawking beat the odds for more than five decades, the scientist <a href=# rel=noopener>told the Guardian</a> in 2011 that death was never far from his mind.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years,” Hawking said. “I’m not afraid of death, but I’m in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here are some of Hawking’s most interesting thoughts about death, the afterlife and God.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Hawking didn’t believe in heaven</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The scientist took a pragmatic view of what happens to the brain and body after death.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail,” he told the Guardian. “There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">He believed in an ‘impersonal God,’ but not a creator</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hawking invoked the name of God in his seminal book A Brief History of Time, writing that if physicists could find a “theory of everything” — that is, a cohesive explanation for how the universe works — they would glimpse “the mind of God.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But in later interviews and writings, such as 2010’s The Grand Design, which he co-wrote with Leonard Mlodinow, Hawking clarified that he wasn’t referring to a creator in the traditional sense.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist,” he wrote in The Grand Design. “It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Using language about God, Hawking <a href=# rel=noopener>told TIME</a> after the book’s release, is more figurative than literal.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“God is the name people give to the reason we are here,” he said. “But I think that reason is the laws of physics rather than someone with whom one can have a personal relationship. An impersonal God.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Hawking considered himself an atheist</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hawking spoke more plainly about his thoughts on God in an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Spanish publication </a>El Mundo.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Before we understand science, it is natural to believe that God created the universe. But now science offers a more convincing explanation,” he said. “What I meant by ‘we would know the mind of God’ is, we would know everything that God would know, if there were a God, which there isn’t. I’m an atheist.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">But still thought the universe had meaning</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though Hawking rejected the conventional notion of God or a creator, he fundamentally believed that the universe and life have meaning, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to the New York Times</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist,” Hawking said of the meaning of life. “Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuaWlufnWFjqyrnqiYmrtutMCwoqKml2Kxpq3ToWSgp5RirrW0xKKqrWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
