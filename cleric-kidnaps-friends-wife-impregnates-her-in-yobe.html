"The suspect operates as a cleric, performing rituals for people. It is alleged that he forced the victim to drink a certain concoction, which made her fall in love with him. He then eloped with her to Anguwan Arewa in Kano," Abdulkarim said.</p><p>The victim’s father reported the abduction to the Tarmuwa Divisional Police Headquarters, alleging Haruna's involvement.</p><p>Following<a href=# id=ba732f69-3a39-4707-8bdb-ca0431625c29 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab> an extensive search</a>, police operatives apprehended Haruna in Kano along with the victim, who was confirmed to be two months pregnant.</p><p>"The investigation is ongoing at the Yobe SCID, and there are certain processes we must follow. Once we complete our investigation, we will transfer the case file to the Yobe State Ministry of Justice. The ministry will review the file and, if satisfied with the investigation, provide legal assistance to the police, leading to the suspect's arraignment in court," Abdulkarim concluded.</p><p>Haruna is likely to be charged to court, as police authorities are working to ensure justice is served for the victim.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0miknqyipHykuMSroJxlm56xr63PrGSfqpmau6W%2FjLCgn51dnrqxvsSgpZqslah6qbHRZqCnZamkr6Z7wpucaamjqQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
