Laura opened her letter, saying, that she and her fiancé Mike have been <a href=# title=dating data-link=tag>dating</a> for a&nbsp;long period of&nbsp;time already. Recently, Mike proposed to&nbsp;Laura and she was over the moon with happiness.</p><p>Laura revealed, «I&nbsp;have been dating Mike, a&nbsp;divorced man with two kids, for five years. Our relationship has always been what people call ’mature’, without any unnecessary drama and overload of&nbsp;emotions. We&nbsp;both already know what we&nbsp;want from life and from each other, and we’re both working hard on&nbsp;our relationship to&nbsp;be&nbsp;healthy and smooth.<br>When Mike proposed to&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;was very happy. I’ve never been <a href=# title=married data-link=tag>married</a> in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life, and I’ve never had a&nbsp;life goal to&nbsp;be&nbsp;married this way or&nbsp;that, but Mike was an&nbsp;ideal partner for me&nbsp;and&nbsp;I knew&nbsp;I would be&nbsp;very safe and comfortable with him.»</p><p>Laura added, «I&nbsp;have never been in&nbsp;love with Mike. I&nbsp;mean, I&nbsp;did have a&nbsp;huge respect for this man and&nbsp;I didn’t love him the way many people would imagine, but in&nbsp;our relationship the romantic side wasn’t a&nbsp;must, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;partnership grounded on&nbsp;mutual trust and the feeling of&nbsp;solid future that we&nbsp;gave each other. This has always been enough for both of&nbsp;us.»</p><p><h2>Mike has never betrayed Laura’s trust, up&nbsp;until one day.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/680/b72/ee83675c278efa565dbccf163a.jpg><p>Laura goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying that Mike has never lied to&nbsp;her. His relationship with his ex-wife has always been an&nbsp;open book for Laura. She knew that they met occasionally and discussed their parenting issues. There was nothing to&nbsp;worry about regarding Mike’s former relationship. But one day, everything changed for Laura.</p><p>The woman wrote, «Mike started to&nbsp;come home very late. It&nbsp;had lasted for over 2,5&nbsp;months. He&nbsp;always explained that he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;heavy workload and that the new project he&nbsp;was working on&nbsp;demanded more time and effort from him than usual. At&nbsp;first, I&nbsp;believed him, but then, I&nbsp;met one of&nbsp;his coworkers in&nbsp;a&nbsp;grocery store. This coworker used to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;our place once or&nbsp;twice, and&nbsp;I recognized him in&nbsp;the store and even stopped for a&nbsp;quick polite chat.<br>We&nbsp;spoke to&nbsp;each other casually, and&nbsp;I mentioned that their new project must have been very hard for both Mike and him. Then I&nbsp;got an&nbsp;unexpected reply that they closed this project a&nbsp;month ago and even had a&nbsp;nice celebration on&nbsp;the occasion of&nbsp;this project being closed. Mike and his coworker have been working in&nbsp;their usual mode since then, and there were no&nbsp;other factors that would make Mike stay late in&nbsp;the office. He&nbsp;was lying to&nbsp;me&nbsp;all this time.»</p><p><h2>Laura confronted Mike, but to&nbsp;no&nbsp;avail.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f6/684/f894705b9d8aaaeb46dcf13f51.jpg><p>ааааа</p><p>After the talk with Mike’s colleague, Laura decided not to&nbsp;beat about the bush and confronted Mike straight away. The woman said, «I&nbsp;just asked him to&nbsp;sit and talk to&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;told him that&nbsp;I knew he&nbsp;was coming late, not because of&nbsp;that project. Mike looked me&nbsp;straight in&nbsp;the eye and said that yes, he&nbsp;was lying to&nbsp;me&nbsp;all this time. But he&nbsp;was doing it&nbsp;for the sake of&nbsp;our relationship.<br>He&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;had arranged some extra work for himself and all he&nbsp;wanted was to&nbsp;earn extra money and then spend it&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;special wedding gift for&nbsp;me. So, basically, he&nbsp;was planning some surprise for me&nbsp;and was trying to&nbsp;earn some more for making this happen.»</p><p>Laura revealed that she had a&nbsp;gut feeling that Mike was lying again. But she pretended that she believed him. She said, «I&nbsp;felt that he&nbsp;was lying, I&nbsp;didn’t have any evidence that he&nbsp;might have been cheating, or&nbsp;something of&nbsp;a&nbsp;kind, but&nbsp;I just felt that all these excuses about the wedding present and the extra work were mere nonsense, I&nbsp;just couldn’t prove&nbsp;it, so&nbsp;I decided to&nbsp;let it&nbsp;slip.»</p><p><h2>The truth was revealed accidentally, when no&nbsp;one expected&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d9d/8b6/2e256b5f8383744633c0ced7b8.jpg><p>Laura goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «This year, on&nbsp;his daughter’s birthday, we&nbsp;went to&nbsp;drop her off at&nbsp;his mom’s house. I&nbsp;hadn’t been there before, as&nbsp;Mike’s mom isn’t a&nbsp;very hospitable person. This time, however, everything was different, to&nbsp;my&nbsp;surprise. I&nbsp;was invited in&nbsp;to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the presents that Mike’s daughter got from her mom and grandmother. My&nbsp;heart sank when&nbsp;I noticed that, on&nbsp;all the walls in&nbsp;the house, there were pictures of&nbsp;Mike and his ex-wife taken on&nbsp;their wedding day, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;other <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and baby pictures.»</p><p>Laura was overwhelmed, because she thought Mike wasn’t so&nbsp;much into the memories about his former <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>. But then, she noticed one more photo that put her into a&nbsp;huge shock, disappointment and despair. Laura wrote, «There was one very fresh photo on&nbsp;the wall in&nbsp;his mom’s hall. It&nbsp;had a&nbsp;date on&nbsp;it, and it&nbsp;was the date when Mike started his ’project’ at&nbsp;work. The photo was of&nbsp;him and his ex-wife, kissing. Turns out, he&nbsp;had been meeting her secretly all this time, and they were in&nbsp;a&nbsp;romantic relationship together. His mom knew about&nbsp;it, and it&nbsp;was her initiative to&nbsp;print this photo and hang it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the wall.»</p><p>Laura concluded, «You can ask me&nbsp;why Mike proposed to&nbsp;me&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;had such deep feelings for his ex-wife. Well, the truth was that Mike and his ex-wife just didn’t want to&nbsp;get married again, but they did have feelings for each other. So, I&nbsp;was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;some kind of ’wife on&nbsp;the paper’, because it&nbsp;was convenient for Mike. And his ex&nbsp;would rip the benefits of&nbsp;his sincere feelings and attitude. All of&nbsp;this&nbsp;I found out from Mike, after&nbsp;I made a&nbsp;huge scandal about these photos and all.»</p><p>Laura wrote that she canceled her wedding and Mike just couldn’t understand why she did&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;his opinion, they had an&nbsp;ideal relationship and his affair with his ex&nbsp;didn’t have an&nbsp;impact on&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;any way. But Laura confessed, «I&nbsp;suddenly realized that&nbsp;I fell in&nbsp;love with Mike. Truly and sincerely. And his affair hurt much, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;his lies. So, my&nbsp;decision to&nbsp;cut it&nbsp;off was painful, but I’d rather spend some time moaning over my&nbsp;unhappy romance than spend the rest of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life with a&nbsp;cheater and a&nbsp;liar like Mike.»</p><p>And here’s yet another dramatic wedding story from a&nbsp;woman, whose husband deeply humiliated her right on&nbsp;their special day.
