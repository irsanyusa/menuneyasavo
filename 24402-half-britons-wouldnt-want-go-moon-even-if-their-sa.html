The nation is split, with 43% saying they would but more (48%) saying they'd turn it down.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Moon20visit20yes20no.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>We asked those who would turn down such an opportunity of a lifetime to say, in their own words, why. The most common answer (23%) was simply that they had no interest in going to the moon.</p><p>Other common answers were that there isn’t enough to see and do on the moon (11%), there are places on Earth they’d rather visit (10%), that there’s no point (9%) or that they rejected the premise that safe return could be guaranteed (also 9%).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Moon20visit20why20not-01.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Women and older Britons are the most likely groups to confine themselves to the Earth’s atmosphere. A majority of female Brits (59%) say they would not want to visit the celestial body, compared to 36% of men.</p><p>Similarly, while 62% of Britons aged 55 and older wouldn’t want to go, this figure is only 32% among those aged from 18 to 24.</p><h4><strong>Is it worth returning to the moon?</strong></h4><p>Britons are also split on whether anyone else should bother to go. Half (49%) believe it’s not important that humanity sends astronauts back to the moon, compared to 41% who think it is. In fact, another question in the survey found that 9% of Brits don’t think human exploration of space should take place at all.</p><p>Space funding likewise divides opinion. One third (35%) think the UK Space Agency’s £371m budget should be reduced or cut entirely, compared to the 29% who think it should stay the same and the 19% who want to see it increased.</p><p>By contrast, a similar survey conducted by YouGov US found Americans far more enamoured with their own space agency. As many as 70% want to see NASA’s budget either protected at current levels or increased.</p><h4><strong>Most Britons don’t think they’ll live to see humanity’s next big step: Mars</strong></h4><p>While returning to the moon would still be a major achievement, it does not have the same emotional resonance as taking an entirely new step and landing a man or woman on Mars. Several proposals have been made to send humans to the red planet, including one by SpaceX’s Elon Musk, <a href=#>who wants to send a crew there in 2024</a>.</p><p>Nevertheless, most Brits (56%) think it's unlikely they will live to see it. Naturally, age plays a key role in this answer: 72% of the over-55s don’t expect to be around when it happens, compared to only 34% of those aged from 18 to 24.</p><p>Photo: Getty</p><p><a href=#><strong>See the full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmmBcX6MoZilnl2Xv6rAzqeqZq%2BfqrmlutNmrpqmpGK0sHnMqKanZZWrsq95yJ9kraCVnr9uv8A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
