However, a&nbsp;lesser-known fact is&nbsp;that he&nbsp;is&nbsp;actually married to&nbsp;none other than superstar and ’90s icon <a href=# title="Winona Ryder" data-link=tag>Winona Ryder</a>. They have been known to&nbsp;be&nbsp;close friends for years now and have starred in&nbsp;several movies together, including the 1992 <i>Bram Stoker’s Dracula</i>, where they accidentally got legally married.</p><p><h2>Their marriage</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39b/ce3/64e16257acaace2b5371cd4a0c.jpg><p>As&nbsp;Winona reveals in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, during the wedding scene in&nbsp;<i>Dracula</i> back in&nbsp;1992, they got married in&nbsp;real life: “We&nbsp;actually got married in&nbsp;<i>Dracula... </i>No, I&nbsp;swear to&nbsp;god, I&nbsp;think we’re married in&nbsp;real life. In&nbsp;that scene, Francis used a&nbsp;real Romanian priest. We&nbsp;shot the master, and he&nbsp;did the whole thing.

He&nbsp;said: “We&nbsp;did a&nbsp;whole take of&nbsp;a&nbsp;marriage ceremony with real priests... Winona says we&nbsp;are [married]. Coppola says we&nbsp;are. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;guess we’re married... under the eyes of&nbsp;God.”</p><p><h2>They’ve had a&nbsp;“big, healthy” crush on&nbsp;each other.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f03/f65/2924885bea812f78e29c503be0.jpg><p>Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/East News</p><p>Being married to&nbsp;each other for the last 30&nbsp;years “under the eyes of&nbsp;God” hasn’t stopped them from falling in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> with other people. Keanu has been together with Alexandra Grant, who he&nbsp;is&nbsp;currently gushing about, since at&nbsp;least 2019.
