This is&nbsp;not the case in&nbsp;Austria. Taking a&nbsp;cab in&nbsp;Austria means you’re either very old and not able to&nbsp;walk anymore, or&nbsp;really rich and can’t be&nbsp;bothered.&nbsp;<a href=#>©&nbsp;Jakob-Manuel Krobath&nbsp;/ Quora</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b6a/b5c/7771365514a720206df1385c05.jpg><ul readability=5.8562367864693><li readability=2.9588235294118><p><strong>The litter-burning factory called Spittelau is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the capital’s business cards.</strong> Tourists get surprised with the way this building looks: its walls are decorated with colorful mosaics, while its golden tops joyfully shine in&nbsp;the sun.

He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;true protector of&nbsp;ecology and <a href=#>started</a> working on&nbsp;the project only when he&nbsp;got ensured that the new plant in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;Vienna wouldn’t bring any harm to&nbsp;the environment.</p></li><li readability=8.7323788546256><p><strong>You may not understand Austrians even if&nbsp;you know German. </strong>If&nbsp;you ask for a&nbsp;“tüte” (the German word for “bag”) at&nbsp;the checkout, you’ll likely get a&nbsp;surprised look.

They are about as&nbsp;expensive as&nbsp;a&nbsp;cup of&nbsp;coffee. Besides the concert itself, visitors can entertain themselves with a&nbsp;free excursion around the theater. “There was a&nbsp;huge queue for the standing room tickets, as&nbsp;expected.
