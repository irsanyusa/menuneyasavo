She accompanied her post with a message written in bold, all-caps."HAPPY BIRTHDAY ROCCO."</p><p>She continued by writing, ''the long and Winding Road through all your many moods and incarnations has been tumultuous and full of surprises. But through it all —your curiosity, and Artistic Soul, has been the glue that has held us together.'' She closed her message by saying that she loved him and thanking her son for choosing her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a0b/317/85a4615b29802d71836e5442fd.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Fans</a> were surprised to see how handsome and grown-up Rocco looks, especially since his public appearances aren't that frequent.</p><p>One fan remarked, "He reminds me of a young Brando," another noted, "Rocco is an exact half of each of his parents."

One notable moment was when, at 15, he <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>chose</a> to live with his father, Guy Ritchie, in the U.K. instead of accompanying his mother on her <i>Rebel Heart Tour</i> in 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ecc/738/6753fc553a8dcec499153c29cd.jpg><p>Recently, though, Madonna’s relationship with Rocco <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appears</a> to have improved. In April, the <i>Material Girl </i>singer was photographed with her son at the exhibition of his art collection at a gallery in Miami, Florida.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4de/617/a0309e5e71a5167604849429e3.jpg><p>We admire Rocco for forging his own path, and his talent as a painter is undeniable. We eagerly anticipate seeing more of his creations in the years ahead.</p><p>Another celebrity child making headlines recently is Moses, the son of Gwyneth Paltrow and Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.
