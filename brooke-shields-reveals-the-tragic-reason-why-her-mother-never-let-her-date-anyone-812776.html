During an&nbsp;appearance on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Drew Barrymore Show</i></a> to&nbsp;discuss her newly released documentary, <i>Pretty Baby</i>, Shields candidly revealed the complexities of&nbsp;her relationship with her mother and the uncommon closeness they shared.</p><p><h2>Turbulent mother-daughter relatonships</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e9e/0c2/ad455952b98e35fae19419ef0e.jpg><p>During the interview, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Endless Love</i></a> actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disclosed</a> that her mother, Teri Shields, who passed away <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>in&nbsp;2012</a>, never dated anyone because she was “in&nbsp;love with her.”</p><p>Shields had recently criticized her for allowing her to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;a&nbsp;renowned magazine at&nbsp;the <a href=#>young age</a> of&nbsp;10. The show’s host, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Drew Barrymore</a>, known for her role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>E.T</i></a>., could relate to&nbsp;Shields’ experiences, sharing her own stories about her own tumultuous relationship with her mother, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jaid Barrymore</a>, who is&nbsp;now 76&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>Shields was cut off from having a&nbsp;personal life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3be/227/b8aea85bb5b9b83cd7b135896d.jpg><p>0000584/Reporter / East News</p><p>During the interview, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>57-year-old</a> actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was asked</a> by&nbsp;Barrymore if&nbsp;her mother had dated any of&nbsp;her partners, similar to&nbsp;what Barrymore experienced with her own mother. Shockingly, Shields responded, “No, because she was in&nbsp;love with&nbsp;me.” The actress went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;reveal that her mother had little interest in&nbsp;men due to&nbsp;her focus on&nbsp;managing Shields’ career.</p><p>Shields further <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> that she was her mom’smain focus, while both of&nbsp;them were cut off from having personal lives. Barrymore then shared her own similar experience, recalling a&nbsp;time when her mother, Jaid Barrymore, tried to&nbsp;date her boyfriend. “My&nbsp;mom was so&nbsp;enamored with me&nbsp;that she wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with the people&nbsp;I was with,” Barrymore said, to&nbsp;which Shields responded, “I&nbsp;get&nbsp;it. It’s so&nbsp;needy and weird.”</p><p><h2>Her mom was needy and possessive, but Shields didn’t seem to&nbsp;mind at&nbsp;the time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5fe/34c/5c676b5abcbdf72b3ea251a978.jpg><p>PHOTOlink/Everett Collection/East News</p><p>Moreover, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Blue Lagoon</i></a><i> </i>actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> that her mother accompanied her to&nbsp;every single interview she had when she was younger, saying, “No&nbsp;one’s going to&nbsp;get you. I’m going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there. You’re mine. I’m not going to&nbsp;give you to&nbsp;somebody.” Shields realized that her mother’s actions were not just about protection, but also about ownership and fear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/eb7/caf/8943aa52c8bd51008acbfbd488.png><p>Despite the suffocating dynamics, the child star admitted that, at&nbsp;the time, she didn’t mind her mother’s behavior because she associated the work she was doing with being able to&nbsp;provide for her mother. “I&nbsp;did a&nbsp;<a href=# title=movie data-link=tag>movie</a> and we&nbsp;got a&nbsp;car. All I&nbsp;knew was to&nbsp;keep my&nbsp;mother alive, keep dancing, and get stuff,” Shields <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>.</p><p>“But to&nbsp;emerge from it&nbsp;not angry or&nbsp;jaded... It’s something in&nbsp;your character. It’s in&nbsp;my&nbsp;character,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reflected</a> Shields.</p><p><h2>She was exploited at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;her career.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ce/766/fcea355530a83e6f1d0d78c5fa.jpg><p>0000584/Reporter / East News</p><p>The actress and model also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opened up</a>&nbsp;about feeling functionally exploited during her early years as&nbsp;a&nbsp;performer. She revealed, “It&nbsp;was fun and loving at&nbsp;times, but... I&nbsp;was just there. I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;pawn, I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;piece, I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;commodity.” The mother of&nbsp;2&nbsp;daughters Rowan, 19, and Grier, 16, had also previously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spoken out</a> about how she would never allow her own children to&nbsp;live the same way she and her mother did.</p><p><h2>She regrets taking part in&nbsp;some of&nbsp;her popular movies.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/347/28d/5667a052b7a01f2d08674fbe94.jpg><p>0000584/Reporter / East News</p><p>Shields additionally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a> her struggle to&nbsp;understand why her mother, Teri Shields, did not prevent her from accepting some of&nbsp;the movies she was&nbsp;in, like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Pretty Baby</i></a>. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> that during the filming of&nbsp;certain scenes, she made a&nbsp;repulsed face but was yelled at&nbsp;by&nbsp;the director. However, her mother did not step in&nbsp;to&nbsp;protect her. The actress spoke about this experience in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview when discussing the documentary.</p><p>“It&nbsp;was hard for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;not justify my&nbsp;mom to&nbsp;them,” Shields <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “But when they asked&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;thought, ’Oh God, I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;admit this.’ I&nbsp;could say, ’Oh, it&nbsp;was the time back then,’ or ’Oh, it&nbsp;was art.’ But I&nbsp;don’t know why she thought it&nbsp;was all right. I&nbsp;don’t know.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK%2Bzu86knGarmJ6yrbDSZqmerpWWubR506GcZqyilrSqr4yrnJqrn6N6uLTYZp%2Beql2ivLW0xKtkp52mmr9uuMStZKGdomKxosDEZpinsZ%2Bjsm6EkGtucG5f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
