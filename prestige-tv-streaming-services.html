(For its major <i>film</i> franchises, Disney has historically <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>clashed with directors</a>, leading many to believe the company wasn’t allowing for much creative independence.)&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“There's a perception of quality surrounding Marvel, and I think that's really paid off big,” Dergarabedian said. “Disney+ has created a perfect platform to do long-form, episodic content, and while Marvel may seem like it's just for the masses, the beauty of it is they can dig deep into these characters and take a lot of risks.”</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Peacock has prestige potential -— if viewers discover its shows&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In its first year, NBCUniversal’s Peacock streaming service had 54 million sign-ups and over 20 million monthly active accounts, per the company’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>second-quarter earnings report</a>, though Comcast Corp. Chief Executive Jeff Shell was less forthcoming in the company’s <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>third-quarter earnings call</a>, simply saying the service is “heading in the right direction” without sharing specific numbers.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“Peacock is getting its footing, and I would never count them out,” said Scott Schiller, global chief commercial officer for the media-marketing services company ENGINE and an adjunct assistant professor at NYU's Stern School of Business. “At the same time what they will need, like any fledgling business needs, is a show or shows that drive usage.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Large viewership is not required to be known as a prestige TV destination. Several critically acclaimed and Emmy-winning shows on FX, for instance, never really caught on with viewers. But the network was able to cultivate that brand over several years of releasing well-received shows, such as “The Americans,” “The Shield” and “Justified.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX6W%2Fpr%2FTop6eZaSrerTA0Z6YpqGenHq0sdGvoJydow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
