Fans of the professional dancer cannot believe how amazing she looks post-pregnancy.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CJrpdA2HHjN/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dancing-with-the-stars-pro-lindsay-arnold-showed-off-post-baby-body>‘Dancing With The Stars’ Pro Lindsay Arnold Showed Off Post-Baby Body</h2><p>Lindsay wore a simple black bikini in Instagram pictures that were taken by her husband. “Vacation time. Instagram husband/dad of the year goes to Sam who is mine and Sage’s personal photographer for this trip” she captioned the post. She stood with her toes dipped in the ocean and flashed a smile for the camera with her post-baby body on full display.</p><p>Fans were completely in disbelief in the comments section that Lindsay just recently gave birth. “And you just had a baby???? Gah your so gorgeous” one fan commented. “No waaaayyyy you just had a baby! Girl, you look amazing” another gushed. She also wore a yellow bikini on her instagram story as she and Sage sat poolside.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘DANCING WITH THE STARS’ PRO WITNEY CARSON GIVES BIRTH TO FIRST CHILD</a></strong></p><p>“You just had a baby.

She called him her “best friend” and said that friendship is “the key to a happy and successful marriage.” The pair were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">high school sweethearts</a> who got engaged in 2014. They were married in 2015. Lindsay began her Dancing With The Stars pro career on season 16 in 2013.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CJtcOgNn-cY/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-name-of-their-daughter-has-a-special-meaning>The Name Of Their Daughter Has A Special Meaning</h3><p>Sage was born eight days early after she was breech. Lindsay underwent a C-section delivery. It was a very special day for Lindsay and Sam that already held onto a lot of memories. “She entered this world on the same day that we lost Sam’s beautiful mother just one year ago and we couldn’t help but see God’s hand in this and know that Sage was handed down to us by her beautiful angel grandmother, Jennifer Jill Gillette Cusick,” Lindsay wrote on Instagram. Sage’s middle name, Jill, is in honor of Sam’s mother.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CHLvXYdHkDS/</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lindsay-arnold-and-her-bestie-witney-carson-were-pregnant-together>Lindsay Arnold And Her Bestie Witney Carson Were Pregnant Together</h3><p>Lindsay’s Dancing With The Stars bestie Witney Carson <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">also just gave birth</a> to a baby boy on January 4. Witney served as the maid of honor at Lindsay’s wedding. She documented her labor in a quick Instagram video.</p><p>“I just can’t believe it. Witney and I are sitting here both pregnant, chatting with Entertainment Tonight!” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lindsay said when the pair were pregnant together.</a> “It’s actually&nbsp;insane. We’ve done so many things in our lives&nbsp;together, so it’s like, naturally,&nbsp;why wouldn’t we get pregnant together? It’s so funny because you can’t really plan a pregnancy. I mean, you can plan when you want to try, but it’s not like it’s always going to happen when you want it to.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CJsLhKlBdFv/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>PREGNANT ASHLEY TISDALE FLASHES BABY BUMP ON ‘THE MASKED DANCER’ — ALL ABOUT HER PREGNANCY</a></strong></p><p>There is no shortage of adorable pictures of baby Sage on Lindsay’s Instagram account.
