He secured a major victory at the 1995 U.S. Open and topped the PGA money list in 1991.</p><p>Pavin attended UCLA and showcased his early golfing talent by winning two gold medals at the 1981 Maccabiah Games and the 1981 North and South Amateur. Turning professional in 1982, he initially struggled to secure his PGA Tour card but found early successes overseas. His first PGA Tour victory came at the 1984 Houston Coca-Cola Open, and by 1991, his consistent performance had made him the Tour's leading money winner.</p><p>His most significant victory was at the 1995 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills, after which Pavin experienced a decline in form. He broke a winless streak of 242 tournaments, however, at the 2006 U.S. Bank Championship in Milwaukee. That same year, he scored a PGA Tour record for the lowest nine-hole score with a 26.</p><p>Pavin participated as a player in the Ryder Cup in 1991, 1993, and 1995 and served as a non-playing captain in 2010, although the U.S. team was unsuccessful under his leadership. On the PGA Tour Champions, Pavin won the Allianz Championship in 2012 and continued competing at a high level.</p><p>His personal life included two marriages, first to Shannon Healy, with whom he had two children, and then to Lisa Nguyen in 2003. His religious conversion from Judaism to Christianity occurred in 1991. Pavin had a brief cameo in Tin Cup (1996) and was inducted into the Ventura County Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>November 16</a>, <a href=#>1959</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Oxnard, California, USA<br><b>Age: <a href=#>64 years old</a></b></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Baby Boomer</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Pig</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Scorpio</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Playing Career</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1994-08-14</a> PGA Championship Men's Golf, Southern Hills CC: <a href=#>Nick Price</a> of Zimbabwe wins his 2nd PGA C'ship by 6 strokes from American Corey Pavin</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1995-06-18</a> US Open Men's Golf, Shinnecock Hills GC: Corey Pavin wins his only major championship, 2 strokes ahead of runner-up <a href=#>Greg Norman</a> of Australia</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2010-07-25</a> British Senior Open Men's Golf, Carnoustie: <a href=#>Bernhard Langer</a> of Germany wins by 1 stroke from American Corey Pavin</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2012-07-15</a> US Senior Open Men's Golf, Indianwood G &CC: Englishman Roger Chapman wins by 2 strokes ahead of <a href=#>Bernhard Langer</a>, <a href=#>Fred Funk</a>, Corey Pavin & <a href=#>Tom Lehman</a></li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2017-07-30</a> British Senior Open Men's Golf, Royal Porthcawl: <a href=#>Bernhard Langer</a> of Germany wins his 3rd Open Senior title by 3 shots from Corey Pavin</li></ul><h2>References</h2><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Golfers</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwr86rnLJloJbDqro%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
