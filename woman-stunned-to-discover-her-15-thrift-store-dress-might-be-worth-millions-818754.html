However, she also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a> that she was not ashamed of&nbsp;it.</p><p>This time, Michalke was doing her usual shopping routine. She was almost done with her shopping when she spotted a&nbsp;bright, shiny evening gown. Michalke <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembered</a>, “I&nbsp;saw the twinkle of&nbsp;the dress and I&nbsp;thought, ’Oh my&nbsp;gosh, this will be&nbsp;so&nbsp;fun to&nbsp;play dress up&nbsp;with,’ and&nbsp;I just tossed it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the cart.” She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continued</a>, “I&nbsp;didn’t look at&nbsp;the label. I&nbsp;didn’t look at&nbsp;anything. I&nbsp;was like, ’My daughters will love this.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b5/12e/ad40d857a182be4957baa82e2f.jpg><p>It&nbsp;wasn’t until Michalke got home that she realized she had found something extraordinary. “When I&nbsp;typed in&nbsp;the designer’s name and I&nbsp;thought, <strong>’NO WAY, THIS IS&nbsp;CRAZY!</strong>’” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a> the moment she discovered she had just<strong> </strong>bought a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>gown crafted by&nbsp;a&nbsp;dressmaker from the Golden Age of&nbsp;Hollywood.</p><p>The fortunate woman <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continued</a>, “And then that’s when&nbsp;I started doing full research on&nbsp;Oleg Cassini and discovered just how iconic he&nbsp;was.” <strong>Michalke bought a&nbsp;vintage dress designed by&nbsp;Oleg Cassini for just $15</strong>. At&nbsp;first, it&nbsp;was the sparkle and elegance of&nbsp;the dress that grabbed Michalke’s eye. But as&nbsp;she inspected it&nbsp;further, she admired the meticulous sequin work and the delicate pearl detailing.</p><p><h2>Oleg Cassini was deeply loved by&nbsp;Hollywood’s elite.</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Oleg Cassini</a> was a&nbsp;legendary fashion designer known for his elegant and innovative creations, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;his close relationships with Hollywood’s elite. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Cassini became synonymous with American fashion, dressing some of&nbsp;the most iconic figures of&nbsp;the era, both on&nbsp;and off the screen. His clientele <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>included</a> Hollywood royalty such as&nbsp;<a href=# title="Grace Kelly" data-link=tag>Grace Kelly</a>, <a href=# title="Audrey Hepburn" data-link=tag>Audrey Hepburn</a>, <a href=# title="Marilyn Monroe" data-link=tag>Marilyn Monroe</a>, Rita Hayworth, Lana Turner, Gina Lollobrigida and many others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/537/de8/afef5e5292b129f54bd10032cd.jpg><p>Cassini’s designs were celebrated for their timeless elegance and attention to&nbsp;detail. He&nbsp;was particularly renowned for his mastery of&nbsp;the sheath dress, which became a&nbsp;staple of&nbsp;women’s fashion during the mid-20th century. His creations embodied the epitome of&nbsp;sophistication and grace, reflecting the glamour of&nbsp;the silver screen and the allure of&nbsp;high society.</p><p><h2>Michalke’s find is&nbsp;unique.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6eb/c8f/d6b86553e7b3cfbb9cb8c1e5c3.jpg><p>Michalke and Marilyn Monroe, both in&nbsp;gowns made by&nbsp;Oleg Cassini.</p><p>What made the $15 discovery even more thrilling was how perfectly the dress fit Michalke. She excitedly shared her discovery on&nbsp;social media, where many users chimed in&nbsp;with their own Cassini-branded pieces. However, Michalke’s find was unique among them. The detail of&nbsp;the dress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suggests</a> it&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;mass-produced item. Upon researching the tag, Michalke learned that the dress might <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>belong</a> to&nbsp;Cassini’s “Black Tie Collection.”</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, “It’s definitely ’80s or&nbsp;earlier because of&nbsp;how the tag is&nbsp;hand-sewn in, and they didn’t use machine sewing until the ’90s, so&nbsp;I know that it’s either ’80s or&nbsp;before, but there’s nothing else&nbsp;I can find on&nbsp;it.”</p><p>Despite her efforts, Michalke couldn’t find anything quite like her shimmering gown. “I&nbsp;can’t find anything like&nbsp;it, and so&nbsp;I’m thinking that’s what makes it&nbsp;even more special. Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;potentially like a&nbsp;one-off piece? Maybe a&nbsp;runway piece. I&nbsp;just don’t know,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mused</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ab/a2d/085d185681b045f35493649dd2.jpg><p>Though Michalke hopes to&nbsp;uncover more about the dress’s history and value, her main joy lies in&nbsp;sharing it&nbsp;with her daughters during dress-up time. “My&nbsp;four-year-old Memphis is&nbsp;obsessed with fashion, and her exact words were, ’Mom, this is&nbsp;iconic,’” Michalke <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> with a&nbsp;laugh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f1d/e26/7c7f9358e7982a277d74e77f71.png><p>Your daughter is right, the dress is iconic!</p><p>Michalke <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lives</a> by&nbsp;the motto, “Boycott being boring,” and this find certainly embodies that sentiment. Her passion for thrift shopping and uncovering hidden treasures at&nbsp;Goodwill has motivated her to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;thrifting guide for others, packed with helpful tips on&nbsp;navigating the clearance rack to&nbsp;find exactly what you’re looking for. “There’s not a&nbsp;bad thrift store. I’ve never met one, and I&nbsp;go thrift shopping at&nbsp;second-hand estate sales, at&nbsp;least four times a&nbsp;week,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSwucCnZKyspaO7prCMraZmnJmosLDCxKtkoZ2iYn52edOhqaKepGLAtbvRnmSdqpWowG65yKCfrWWSmnq4u9Gtn2almaG5qrvNrGRxaWhsgnV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
