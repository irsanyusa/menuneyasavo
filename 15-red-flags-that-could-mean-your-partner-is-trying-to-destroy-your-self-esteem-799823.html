We&nbsp;can be&nbsp;highly self-confident and yet can have profoundly low self-esteem, like for example many celebrities, who can perform before an&nbsp;audience of&nbsp;thousands but then damage themselves with an&nbsp;unhealthy lifestyle. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a>, our self-esteem may be&nbsp;influenced by&nbsp;our partner, and they can have a&nbsp;hand in&nbsp;both destroying it&nbsp;and increasing it&nbsp;for&nbsp;us.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side, </strong>we&nbsp;were surprised to&nbsp;find out that even our partners’ best intentions can cause trouble in&nbsp;our relationship. Let’s take a&nbsp;more detailed look at&nbsp;these situations.</p><p><h2>1. Takes too much initiative in&nbsp;making decisions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/671/804/c1fafb53b7b818cda0e3a57a5c.jpg><p>Even if&nbsp;you are a&nbsp;partner who doesn’t like to&nbsp;make decisions, sometimes you may feel it’s important that both of&nbsp;you take part in&nbsp;choosing something. If&nbsp;your partner decides on&nbsp;their own, they may be&nbsp;sending you a&nbsp;<a href=#>message</a> that it’s not worth it&nbsp;to&nbsp;ask you, because you don’t know enough about the subject or&nbsp;they feel like your opinion is&nbsp;not important. This can range from choosing new curtains for your apartment to&nbsp;deciding where to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;vacation: they’ll always choose on&nbsp;their own.</p><p><h2>2. Chooses photos to&nbsp;post on&nbsp;social media without asking if&nbsp;you like them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d29/dce/90dc7b5e009b3630ab1ee8b0be.jpg><p>It’s cute when your partner says they love the way you look when you’re tired, or&nbsp;sick, or&nbsp;in&nbsp;your sweatpants. But <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> is&nbsp;commonly a&nbsp;public thing and sometimes you simply wouldn’t want someone else to&nbsp;see the photos of&nbsp;you that you don’t think are that nice. When your partner <a href=#>doesn’t ask</a> you before posting these photos, you may interpret it&nbsp;as&nbsp;their wish to&nbsp;show you in&nbsp;a&nbsp;worse light and themselves in&nbsp;a&nbsp;better light, and this can be&nbsp;an&nbsp;explosive blow to&nbsp;your self-esteem. Even if&nbsp;they meant nothing but the best for you, it’s always better to&nbsp;arrive to&nbsp;a&nbsp;decision about pictures together.</p><p><h2>3. Interrupts you while you’re talking.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5df/3bd/23e3f7576ba67314bc8914f8df.jpg><p>Interrupting is&nbsp;rude. Sometimes they don’t mean anything by&nbsp;it&nbsp;— they’re just too excited or&nbsp;they’re afraid they’ll forget what they had to&nbsp;say. But mostly, interrupting someone makes that person <a href=#>feel</a> like you weren’t listening, and that what they are trying to&nbsp;say is&nbsp;not important. Is&nbsp;there anything worse than the moment when you realize that no&nbsp;one really cares about what you are trying to&nbsp;say? If&nbsp;it&nbsp;happens often, you’ll start to&nbsp;feel like you should just stop talking at&nbsp;all, because what’s the point?</p><p><h2>4. Questioning your decisions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/743/81b/fd6f7658cb9e282c80f5fb9d14.jpg><p>Sometimes they object to&nbsp;the smallest things. Like they may think they’re being helpful by&nbsp;always questioning whether your outfit is&nbsp;weather-appropriate: “Are you sure you don’t need warmer boots?” Sometimes it’s even more persistent: “Babe, you definitely don’t want to&nbsp;change your job. It’s cool and&nbsp;I think a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people would love to&nbsp;work there.”</p><p>On&nbsp;the surface, it&nbsp;may look sweet and they totally mean well, but after the millionth time, it’s like, “Does he&nbsp;think I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;child and cannot make good decisions?” Because of&nbsp;their <a href=#>constant doubts</a>, they make you think you’re not capable of&nbsp;acting independently and may be&nbsp;“killing” your ability to&nbsp;make decisions by&nbsp;yourself.</p><p><h2>5. Through negative body language (like rolling their eyes).</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/242/380/63f1b3512f85a473c3dc472878.jpg><p><a href=# title="Body language" data-link=tag>Body language</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong weapon. Often, it&nbsp;speaks volumes when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;warm and private <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a>. <a href=#>Rolling their eyes</a> may send the message: “What you’ve just said is&nbsp;ridiculous” and you may interpret it&nbsp;as: “You’re stupid and&nbsp;I <a href=#>despise</a> you in&nbsp;my&nbsp;thoughts.” If&nbsp;we&nbsp;are talking about body language, a&nbsp;crossing of&nbsp;the arms, looking at&nbsp;a&nbsp;phone screen when a&nbsp;partner is&nbsp;talking, or&nbsp;generally looking distracted are also ways they could be&nbsp;signaling to&nbsp;you “I&nbsp;don’t care,” “stop talking,” or&nbsp;even worse.</p><p><h2>6. Being lazy about things that mean a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/933/e67/707a185b86a1ace7fe0e1bb229.jpg><p>Maybe you are an&nbsp;amateur singer or&nbsp;an&nbsp;artist, and you really want your partner to&nbsp;come support you at&nbsp;your performance. Or&nbsp;you just want them to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;some common domestic routines, or&nbsp;go&nbsp;for a&nbsp;walk together. But they hate art and would prefer to&nbsp;stay at&nbsp;home rather than go&nbsp;outside, so&nbsp;even their body language is&nbsp;telling you: “I’d rather die than do&nbsp;your thing.”</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship, partners sometimes need to&nbsp;suck it&nbsp;up&nbsp;and make an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;be&nbsp;supportive. Otherwise, you take their message as&nbsp;them not caring about things that are important to&nbsp;you, and maybe that your happiness isn’t enough of&nbsp;a&nbsp;priority for them. Being <a href=#>ignored</a> can hurt your confidence.</p><p><h2>7. Providing constant suggestions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8b0/1c9/b529ce5b0ea116c0c311cdef17.jpg><p>We&nbsp;often think that constant suggestions are a&nbsp;sign that we&nbsp;are paying attention, that we&nbsp;care about what is&nbsp;happening, and that we’re helpful. In&nbsp;reality, your partner may be&nbsp;so&nbsp;<a href=#>persistent</a> in&nbsp;suggesting that you do&nbsp;other things, rather than the things you’ve chosen, that one day you may feel like you never get anything right. Good intentions, negative results. On&nbsp;the contrary, if&nbsp;they wait until you specifically ask for a&nbsp;suggestion, this is&nbsp;a&nbsp;good sign that they trust your choices.</p><p><h2>8. Talks down to&nbsp;you like you’re a&nbsp;kid.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6e9/dae/e60f8c5f379fad585436fb0caf.jpg><p>It’s not that pleasant when one adult talks down to&nbsp;the other like they’re a&nbsp;small child. You may feel over-embarrassed and belittled when your partner <a href=#>acts</a> like this in&nbsp;public or&nbsp;even in&nbsp;private. This attitude makes people feel demeaned and worthless. If&nbsp;your partner speaks to&nbsp;you in&nbsp;this way, they aren’t showing you the respect that you deserve.</p><p><h2>9. Your partner says “no” to&nbsp;the majority of&nbsp;ideas that you have.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/683/eab/a3eb505276a77d21853a28fb46.jpg><p>Saying no&nbsp;is&nbsp;cool, and psychologists believe people should do&nbsp;it&nbsp;more. But if&nbsp;your partner says “no” to&nbsp;every idea that you have, they’re not actually being encouraging or&nbsp;supportive, and that can absolutely crash your self-esteem. When you hear “no” every time you suggest something or&nbsp;think about doing something cool, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=#>hard</a> to&nbsp;feel like you have good idea. You end up&nbsp;feeling like you have no&nbsp;freedom to&nbsp;seek your own happiness and comfort.</p><p><h2>10. They re-check or&nbsp;re-do the things that you’ve already done.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/974/20d/9aa28450f3b8548bcea17a8d79.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you follow your partner and re-check or&nbsp;re-do everything they just did, you’re literally telling them that they don’t even cope with things correctly. Sure, it’s nice to&nbsp;double-check things from time to&nbsp;time, especially if&nbsp;they’re related to&nbsp;safety issues, but mostly, if&nbsp;the job is&nbsp;done in&nbsp;a&nbsp;good way, you <a href=#>shouldn’t</a> diminish your partner’s efforts. And if&nbsp;you just can’t help yourself, at&nbsp;least re-wash a&nbsp;dish or&nbsp;re-make the bed when they aren’t around and don’t see this.</p><p><h2>11. They always leave you guessing because their words and actions don’t match.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e7/4d0/81aba657209f3084c98f8b859d.jpg><p>Your partner may suggest going out to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;cool movie together or&nbsp;buying new furniture for your apartment, and you are happy that you’ll have a&nbsp;nice time or&nbsp;do&nbsp;something for your house together. Then they change their mind all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden and suggest that you shift the date or&nbsp;cancel your plans without even giving you a&nbsp;reason. This makes you constantly feel like you are to&nbsp;blame for this sudden change. Maybe you said something wrong that made them change their mind? This behavior greatly <a href=#>undermines</a> your self-value.</p><p><h2>12. They give you too much advice or&nbsp;offer too much help.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/11b/44e/151e8756ba855ac0d3e571e362.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you succeed at&nbsp;something, your partner may feel competitive and may hold you back because they’re jealous of&nbsp;your successes. This kind of&nbsp;attitude devours all of&nbsp;your self-confidence. They may constantly <a href=#>offer</a> their help or&nbsp;always give you unwanted advice just to&nbsp;show that they may know better and can do&nbsp;better. With this interference, you simply can’t pursue your dreams or&nbsp;achieve success, because you’re always hesitant. You start feeling like you need their advice all the time because your own knowledge and skills are simply not enough.</p><p><h2>13. They refuse to&nbsp;argue.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e8/aac/0405df56eeba92a453bc7d1ed8.jpg><p>It’s pretty logical that if&nbsp;your partner refuses to&nbsp;fight, it&nbsp;means they don’t think something is&nbsp;worth fighting for. If&nbsp;they always <a href=#>close the debate</a> or&nbsp;say things like, “I&nbsp;don’t even want to&nbsp;argue about this with you” they’re sending the message that they think they’re always right, or&nbsp;that they simply don’t care about what you have to&nbsp;say. This can fuel a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;worthlessness in&nbsp;you. They don’t have to&nbsp;fight, literally, but they should let you have your say too.</p><p><h2>14. Misplacing your feelings.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c91/9a2/a11d2b5f92b11bf64faee4c47d.jpg><p>Your partner may be&nbsp;stressed from life, upset about their work, or&nbsp;worried about something. But it’s not right to&nbsp;take it&nbsp;out on&nbsp;you. When they’re always sad, unhappy, or&nbsp;impatient, they make you feel like it’s your fault. You may just accept it&nbsp;as&nbsp;them not liking you that much, or&nbsp;that you simply can’t make them happy. But their happiness isn’t your responsibility and they, of&nbsp;course, need to&nbsp;express their feelings. But this always has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href=#>communicated</a> properly to&nbsp;avoid a&nbsp;situation where you take everything personally, just because you lack information.</p><p><h2>15. They express conditional love.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0db/e1d/1104b3585ab979833c48651d15.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you constantly need to&nbsp;earn your partner’s love and approval, it&nbsp;can make you feel as&nbsp;if&nbsp;you are not good enough for them. You wake up&nbsp;every morning trying to&nbsp;always do&nbsp;the right things. This behavior is&nbsp;<a href=#>not a&nbsp;sign</a> of&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy relationship. Your partner doesn’t act like a&nbsp;loving person toward you. You should not get involved in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship where you constantly need to&nbsp;perform to&nbsp;be&nbsp;loved. You deserve love for who you are, not what you can&nbsp;do.</p><p>What is&nbsp;something other people say or&nbsp;do&nbsp;that makes you feel less confident?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52edGem2aenJa0tHnToZitZZOkwq2wjKacmqZdrry2voypmKusnpq%2FbrXSZqursZmjtG7Azmabnqukp7y6ediorKtlo5q5p3nErKuenZ1ihHqFl2tqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
