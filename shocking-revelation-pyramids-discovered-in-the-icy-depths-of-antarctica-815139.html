Like this mysterious pyramid discovered in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Antarctica data-link=tag>Antarctica</a>. Soon enough the internet blew up&nbsp;with all sorts of&nbsp;theories regarding this unusual shape. Could it&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign from a&nbsp;different life form? Is&nbsp;this pyramid indeed natural, or&nbsp;is&nbsp;it&nbsp;man-made?</p><p>For starters, it’s not the first time we’ve discovered a&nbsp;pyramid in&nbsp;the Antarctic. The first one was observed by&nbsp;the British Antarctic Expedition in&nbsp;the 1910s and kept secret for a&nbsp;long time. Its discovery being kept hidden only added to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=mystery data-link=tag>mystery</a>. A&nbsp;second such structure was discovered in&nbsp;2016, which further increased the interest in&nbsp;the matter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/36f/419/5ab9a45bd1a8696809981f2563.png><p>The mystery was soon enough deciphered by&nbsp;scientists: these formations are just mountains. They’re located near the Ellsworth Mountains, a&nbsp;range over 250 miles long. So, they are just mountain peaks that have broken through the ice sheet. As&nbsp;for their particular shape: it’s just a&nbsp;coincidence.</p><p>Pyramids are found throughout nature. The Matterhorn in&nbsp;the Alps and Mount Bulandstindur in&nbsp;Iceland, for example, are quite similar in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;shape. As&nbsp;for the official name of&nbsp;these peaks, they’re called nunataks, or&nbsp;peaks of&nbsp;rock peeking through a&nbsp;glacier or&nbsp;an&nbsp;ice sheet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bb1/401/3415ea5e5b84a86557b29eb008.png><p>Antarctica has way more incredible features. Like the fact that it’s the home of&nbsp;60&nbsp;to&nbsp;90% of&nbsp;the world’s fresh water. That’s because its ice sheet is&nbsp;the biggest on&nbsp;our planet, stretching across 5.4 million square miles. I’ll spare you the calculations, but that leaves only&nbsp;1% of&nbsp;the continent ice-free. Antarctica’s ice reaches 2.7 miles thick at&nbsp;its deepest point, meaning half the height of&nbsp;Mount Everest! Should it&nbsp;ever melt completely, our sea levels would rise to&nbsp;roughly 200&nbsp;ft.</p><p>It&nbsp;wasn’t always this cold here though. At&nbsp;some point in&nbsp;our planet’s history, Antarctica had the same average temperatures as&nbsp;the city of&nbsp;Melbourne has today. It&nbsp;took a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;research, but scientists figured out that Antarctica’s temperatures could have reached up&nbsp;to&nbsp;62.6°F.&nbsp;Sure, that was 40-50 million years ago, but if&nbsp;you think about&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;was at&nbsp;the same time when dinosaurs roamed our Earth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9f6/64b/babd1d5872880128b529d03ea4.png><p>Time is&nbsp;also different on&nbsp;this icy continent. All the lines of&nbsp;longitude, that help&nbsp;us calculate different time zones, merge into a&nbsp;single point at&nbsp;the South Pole. Here, there are 6&nbsp;months of&nbsp;daylight in&nbsp;the summer followed by&nbsp;6&nbsp;months of&nbsp;complete darkness during the colder season. So, scientists working here stay on&nbsp;average in&nbsp;the same time zone they’ve come from.</p><p>The Blood Falls aren’t a&nbsp;chapter of&nbsp;a&nbsp;thriller movie, they are merely a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;waterfalls located in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the driest regions of&nbsp;Antarctica. They emerge from an&nbsp;underground lake, filled with a&nbsp;special type of&nbsp;<a href=# title=bacteria data-link=tag>bacteria</a>. These little organisms use sulfates as&nbsp;fuel, instead of&nbsp;sugars, which makes them very intriguing for scientists. The water contained in&nbsp;this lake is&nbsp;so&nbsp;full of&nbsp;iron in&nbsp;it&nbsp;that it&nbsp;basically just rusts when it&nbsp;meets air. So, the reddish color of&nbsp;the waterfall also gives it&nbsp;its trademark name.</p><p>The Megalodon was the largest predator ever known in&nbsp;our planet’s history. In&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;its location, the Megalodon lived practically in&nbsp;all waters on&nbsp;our globe, except near the poles. The reason why there were no&nbsp;Megalodon teeth found in&nbsp;Antarctica is&nbsp;probably because the gigantic creature was adapted to&nbsp;only warm tropical and subtropical waters. If&nbsp;you plan to&nbsp;visit Antarctica by&nbsp;boat someday, just know you might not get there on&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-metallic boat.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fdb/144/1c0a2a59ffb31fe3563504d5c6.png><p>The hull of&nbsp;your transportation device must be&nbsp;made of&nbsp;either steel or&nbsp;aluminum to&nbsp;withstand the harsh weather conditions here. Antarctica isn’t home to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;bugs. In&nbsp;fact, there is&nbsp;only one true species of&nbsp;insect that calls this place home: it’s a&nbsp;wingless midge called Belgica Antarctica. This fly is&nbsp;so&nbsp;tiny that it&nbsp;only reaches 0.08 to&nbsp;0.23 inches long. But it’s still the Antarctic’s largest terrestrial animal!</p><p>A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;Antarctic fish also come with an&nbsp;antifreeze substance in&nbsp;their blood. They don’t necessarily need it&nbsp;for protection against the cold temperature, but mostly against touching ice. These anti-freezes are made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;large glycoprotein molecules. They surround any small ice crystals that may form, making sure they don’t spread throughout the animal’s tissues, which could cause a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;damage. They also create a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;small pillow, blocking the sharp ice crystals, so&nbsp;they are less likely to&nbsp;cause any pain. It&nbsp;also doesn’t rain a&nbsp;lot here on&nbsp;this icy continent, but one amazing meteorological quirk of&nbsp;Antarctica is&nbsp;that it’s full of&nbsp;diamond dust!</p><p>This dust is&nbsp;basically small ice crystals that pop out of&nbsp;humid air close to&nbsp;the Earth’s surface. Think of&nbsp;it&nbsp;like an&nbsp;icy fog. As&nbsp;they flow through the air and get touched by&nbsp;sunlight, they begin to&nbsp;sparkle, making visitors here feel like they are surrounded by&nbsp;diamonds. It’s probably the last place you’d want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;into labor, but in&nbsp;1978, the first person was born here, ever. Emile Marco Palma was its name, and ever since, 10&nbsp;other people have been born here in&nbsp;Antarctica.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ffa/853/e0e77a5e6fb2c945fba0cb78a3.png><p>There’s a&nbsp;lake on&nbsp;this icy continent that is&nbsp;so&nbsp;full of&nbsp;<a href=# title=salt data-link=tag>salt</a>, it&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;impossible for it&nbsp;to&nbsp;freeze over, even if&nbsp;temperatures can go&nbsp;as&nbsp;low as&nbsp;5&nbsp;degrees F! That’s because pure water freezes at&nbsp;32°F.&nbsp;Water that has salt in&nbsp;it (or&nbsp;any other substance for that matter) will still freeze but at&nbsp;a&nbsp;way lower temperature. That lower temperature is&nbsp;adjustable, depending on&nbsp;the substance itself and the amount that has been placed into the water.</p><p>Antarctica was the last official continent to&nbsp;be&nbsp;discovered. It&nbsp;remained completely unseen until the 1820s. But it&nbsp;took another 20&nbsp;years to&nbsp;confirm it&nbsp;was actually a&nbsp;continent and not just a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;icy islands. Just because it’s really cold here doesn’t mean you can’t go&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;date here!</p><p>One December night, an&nbsp;American scientist that was posted in&nbsp;Antarctica logged into a&nbsp;dating app simply out of&nbsp;curiosity. He&nbsp;was certain no&nbsp;other profiles would show&nbsp;up, but to&nbsp;his surprise, he&nbsp;found someone soon enough. Another researcher who was stationed just 45-minutes away&nbsp;— by&nbsp;helicopter, of&nbsp;course. They eventually got together and went on&nbsp;the first date in&nbsp;Antarctica ever recorded!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3fa/91a/c3fcdd548dbdf5ee6c7e85bb9d.png><p>Apart from ice, this continent has something else way more abundantly than any other piece of&nbsp;land on&nbsp;Earth: meteorites! If&nbsp;we&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the research done by&nbsp;scientists, meteorites have equal chances of&nbsp;reaching any place on&nbsp;our planet. However, once they go&nbsp;through our atmosphere, the situation is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit more complex. That’s because different climates on&nbsp;our planet, like the humid ones found near the jungle, have a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;moisture and oxygen which will corrode most meteorites.</p><p>The climate in&nbsp;Antarctica is&nbsp;really dry, so&nbsp;the possibility of&nbsp;meteorites corroding is&nbsp;little to&nbsp;none. More&nbsp;so, it’s way easier to&nbsp;spot these rocks on&nbsp;the icy, white surface of&nbsp;this area, than in&nbsp;any other place on&nbsp;Earth. If&nbsp;you’re not scared of&nbsp;the cold, you’ll surely freak out when you hear about the winds here. That’s because Antarctica is&nbsp;for the most part the windiest place on&nbsp;Earth. Wind speeds have been reported here to&nbsp;reach even 200&nbsp;mph!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCpu8KkoKefXaeyt7HLmquip55ivbq%2BwKagnatdmba0r86vnKudlGK2r3nToZxmoZOueqWxz62frGWfm3qiutOaqZysmZiuboSQbmhscV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
