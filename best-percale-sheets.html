First, it’s important to figure out how much you want to spend. You’ll likely be using these sheets night after night, for years in a row, so you may want to invest in premium quality—but a higher price isn’t always the right choice for you. If you plan to upgrade your bed to a different size in the near future, it may not make sense to spend a lot on sheets that won’t fit that new frame.</p><h3>Do I want a flat sheet?</h3><p>While some of these sheet sets include both a fitted sheet and a flat sheet, others offer a flat sheet as an optional extra—for an additional cost. Consider if you actually use a flat sheet regularly at home, or if you prefer to use a duvet cover or other set of bed linens. If the sheet is included in the set then this question may not be important, but knowing in advance what your preferences are could save you money that would be wasted on an extra sheet.</p><h3>What features are most important to me?</h3><p>Some people want a smooth bedspread and will prioritize sheets that don’t require ironing after every wash. Others will value Egyptian cotton, organic fibers, or sheets that have more softness than the average percale material. Then, there are those who are shopping for a specific color scheme or aesthetic and need to find sheets that will complement their existing decor. While we recommend every set of sheets on this list, they each have different strengths, so it’s good to know what you value most before you make your selection.</p><h3>What kind of bed will I be using these sheets on?</h3><p>These sheets will only make your bed better if they’re designed to fit the bed you have. It’s not just about the size of your bed frame—although that is critical—but also about the depth of your mattress, so double check these details before you purchase. You’ll notice not every sheet set comes in a size Twin XL, so keep that in mind.</p><h2 id=percale-sheets-vs-sateen-sheets-vs-linen-sheets>Percale sheets vs. sateen sheets vs. linen sheets</h2><p>Sheets come in many styles and fabrics, to suit different kinds of sleepers. To find out if you want percale linens, or should instead go for sateen or linen sheets, ask yourself these questions.</p><h3>Do I run hot or cold at night?</h3><p>Most of us will know if we run hot or cold in our sleep, ignoring the external temperature of the room. If you’re a hot sleeper, then you won’t want a heavy fabric that will trap body heat; Instead, you want something light and breathable like percale. Sateen is better for those who run cold and want some extra coziness, as the weave is tighter. Linen is a good middle-ground as it’s a looser weave, known for being cool on warm nights but providing good weight and warmth on colder nights.</p><h3>Do I want something soft or crisp?</h3><p>All sheets should be soft enough to sleep on, but there’s a big difference in feel between percale, sateen, and linen. Percale has a crisp, cool feeling that can be refreshing, while sateen is silkier on skin and heavier. Linen is once again in the middle: While it can be a little scratchy initially, after each wash the fabric becomes softer and it is usually a mid-weight.</p><h3>Will I be using these sheets year-round?</h3><p>Depending on your local climate, you may want a different set of sheets for summer and winter or you may be able to use the same fabric year-round. Warm climates are more suited for percale and linen, while cold climates will benefit from sateen—or even something heavier like flannel. For a mild climate with smaller seasonal changes, linen could be a sensible option that is able to handle these fluctuations.</p><h2 id=how-we-chose-the-best-percale-sheets>How we chose the best percale sheets</h2><p>To identify the best percale sheets on the market, we consulted experts, customers, and our own personal experience to ensure a variety of trusted perspectives. We used a mixture of research, reviews, and product testing to create our final list. We assessed each product on a set of criteria that included price point, fiber quality, breathability, crispness, size, and color selection, and set components. We considered what different customers would value most from their sheets and identified the <a rel=alternate href=#>best sheets</a> for those needs.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is percale?</h3><p>Percale doesn’t refer to a specific textile but to a specific weave; percale can come in many fibers, although every sheet set listed here is made from cotton. Specifically, a percale weave uses a one-over, one-under weave that creates a more breathable fabric than a sateen weave, which uses a one-over, three-to-five-under pattern. Percale fabrics are therefore cooler to the touch and more crisp, a desirable trait to many sleepers.</p><h3>What is the best thread count on percale sheets?</h3><p>Though the debates around the <a rel=alternate href=#>best thread count for sheets</a> will continue around the internet seemingly indefinitely, there are some general numbers you can go by before you go buy. The recommended range of thread count for percale sheets is between 200 and 400. Higher than 400 and you risk a too dense fabric that doesn’t offer the breathability that percale is prized for. Too low and the resulting fabric will be scratchy and unpleasant to sleep on. Every sheet set in this selection (with a listed thread count) falls within this range, with some opting for the lower end to increase cooling, and others leaning higher for a softer feel.</p><h3>Are percale sheets better than cotton sheets?</h3><p>Percale sheets and cotton sheets don’t need to be mutually exclusive, with most percale sheets being made of cotton. However, cotton sheets can also come in a sateen weave, so it’s easier to find the right choice for you by assessing sheets by their weave as well as their fiber. Percale isn’t better than sateen per se, it’s more about personal preference. For hot sleepers, people who live in warmer climates, or simply those who like a crisper bedsheet, percale will likely be a better choice than another form of cotton sheet. And if you really sweat through the night, you may want to read our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best cooling sheets</a>, the best cooling mattresses, and possibly the best men’s or women’s pajamas for a more comfortable night’s rest.</p><h3>How do you wash percale sheets?</h3><p>Most percale sheets don’t require complicated laundering, but there are a few standard practices to keep them in best condition and avoid shrinkage or pilling. In general, it’s recommended to wash sheets on a cool setting with similar colors, to avoid fabric damage or color bleeding. To dry, it’s recommended to use a low setting on the dryer, as high temperatures can stiffen fibers, fade colors and shrink the overall sheets. Avoid using fabric softener or bleach, as these can damage fibers.</p><p>Some people want to iron their sheets and percale is suitable for that, just be mindful of the temperature setting to ensure you don’t burn the fabric. If possible, don’t iron too often to prevent heat damage and, when you do iron, do so while the material is still damp. It’s also a good idea to wash new sheets before using, to help soften the fabric and remove any lingering smells or stiffness from the packaging. If you’re wondering <a rel=alternate href=#>how often you should wash your sheets</a>, the quick answer is once per week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1loJq%2FpK3LnmSsoJWawbR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
