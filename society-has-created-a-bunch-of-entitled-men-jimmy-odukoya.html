If you're asking for submission, what vision is she submitting to? I dare say that society has failed and we have raised a lot of entities boys In men's bodies. You see , they have grown in age but have not grown in maturity, their physical DNA has changed but their mindset is still young."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Society has failed because what you will find is that they tell the boy when he is growing up to sit down and not do anything 'you're a boy, ah ah don't worry, relax it's the woman's job to clean, it's the girls job to cook," he added.</p><p>Going on, <a href=# id=fbf9fe13-aead-486c-a27d-1b39e066de3a data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>the pastor</a> underscored the importance of teaching boys responsibility, accountability, and life skills, challenging the prevalent mindset that leads to an entitlement complex.</p><p>"So You're teaching the girl the girl responsibility from a young age, you're teaching her accountability and hard work and life skills.But the boy, you tell him to sit down because he's a man so he grows up with an entitlement mindset with no skills and no responsibility or accountability and then he tells women to submit to him, but what is his vision? You can't call yourself the head of the home and you're not doing anything, respect is earned and not given," Odukoya stressed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGasp5OesrXFjKGYrGWTp7KiwMSdZJplkqq7pLSMqJ1mnZ6ptrW4xJ1kpp2eYrequcyyZKicpaC8uq2Oaa2ymmifsw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
