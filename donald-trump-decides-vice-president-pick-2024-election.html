He responded, “in my mind, yeah,” and added that “nobody knows” who the choice is. Per Trump, whoever it is will “most likely” be at Thursday’s CNN presidential debate in Atlanta, the first against his Democrat opponent President Joe Biden.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“<a href=#>They'll be there</a>,” he said. “I think we have a lot of people coming.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an interview for TIME’s <a href=#>April cover story</a> , the former President claimed that many people have been asking to be his Vice President.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Everybody wants to work for me.

Congressman Byron Donalds and Congresswoman <a href=#>Elise Stefanik</a> are also widely believed to be on Trump's shortlist.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2016, Trump strategically chose <a href=#>Mike Pence</a> as his running mate—a fiscal and social conservative who comforted the more traditional Republicans and widened Trump’s support base. The question is whether he will use a similar strategy this time around, or double down with his already devoted MAGA base.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Here's a Look at Trump's VP Shortlist and Why Each Contender May Get Picked</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is not the first time Trump has enjoyed toying with the media over his VP decision.
