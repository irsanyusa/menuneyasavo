(Bear with me.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Seismic cultural shifts over the last decade suggest that the monogamy imperative’s days are numbered. Digital technology—innumerable dating sites, hook-up apps and social media platforms—have made sex far more accessible than it’s ever been, proving the comedian Chris Rock’s <a href=# rel=noopener>joke</a> increasingly true: you’re only as faithful as your options. Today, up to 75% of us stray in one form or another according Perel, author of the best-selling <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Mating in Captivity</i></a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Alongside the proliferation of sexual opportunities for regular Joes and Janes, America’s greater acceptance of same-sex love and desire has strongly challenged conventional sexual morality. Some <a href=# rel=noopener>legal scholars even argue</a> that the logic laid out in the Supreme Court’s opinion in <i>Lawrence vs. Texas</i>, which over-turned anti-sodomy laws, set the groundwork for the decriminalization of adultery laws, which are rarely enforced but still on the books in more than 20 states.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While sexual progressives have long advocated for the superior ethics of sexual freedom and full disclosure, the sense of rightness derived from divulging or confessing says more about our fraught attitudes toward sexuality than it does about the higher ethics of transparency.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The inclination to confess an extramarital affair, or demand the details of a spouse’s sexual conquests in an open relationship stems, in part, from a Judeo-Christian morality that views all sex as inherently dirty and suspect—and hence, in need of 24-hour surveillance and control. It also derives from an antediluvian belief that marriage means a kind of merging that renders the very notion of privacy anathema or moot.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If the idea of a “private life” outside marriage sounds oxymoronic, it’s because we’ve so thoroughly romanticized the fusion of ourselves with our partners as a kind of testament to the depths of our intimacy. But a dark shadow hovers over this ideal that harkens back to colonial times: coverture laws.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Under coverture,” Stephanie Coontz, an eminent family historian at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., and author of <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Marriage, a History</i></a>, told me, “a man and a woman became one in the eyes of the law and he was the head of that one. Any property she had or income she earned was his.” A mere appendage of her husband, she didn’t exist as a discrete subject before the law. If she suffered injury at the hands of her spouse, including rape, she had no legal recourse because suing him would be akin to suing herself.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It took two feminist revolutions before those laws were dismantled and women could emerge from matrimony their own subjects. And yet, contemporary conceptions of marital intimacy seem like a longing for that shackling oneness, where privacy is seen as an affront to spousal cohesion, and our partners are entitled to investigate and police us, as if we are children.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But privacy is vital to our autonomy and self-growth. In fact, right-to-privacy arguments are at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions that have secured our freedom to self-determine: <i>Eisenstadt v. Baird</i> safeguarded single people’s access to contraception; <i>Roe v. Wade</i> legalized abortion, protecting women’s reproductive choice; and <i>Lawrence</i> insured our freedom to forge intimate association with whomever we choose.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As much as we may yearn for a womb-like oneness with our spouses, our well-established right to privacy doesn’t end in matrimony. Federal laws protect all of us from intrusive and surreptitious modes of spousal scrutiny. Jane Bambauer, a privacy law expert at The University of Arizona, summed it up via email: “The Federal Wiretap Act and Stored Communications Act protects everybody from unconsented interception or access to their personal communications. Also, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act protects people’s computers and online accounts from unauthorized access. There are a wide range of cases finding that spouses who spy on each other by logging into their email accounts or installing software to surveil their activities on a shared or personal computer are liable under these statutes.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The irony of women’s enduring allegiance to monogamy—and our misguided belief that we have the right to keep vigil at our spouse’s zipper—is that historically it was designed to harness women’s lusts, <i>not </i>men’s. Katherine Franke, a distinguished professor at Columbia School of Law and author of <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Wedlocked: The Perils of Marriage Equality</i></a>, said in a recent telephone interview: “The rule of monogamy was really about controlling women’s sexuality because, of course, men were going off and having sex with other people, but they wanted to be sure their wives were producing their genetic offspring for inheritance purposes.” Coontz added that it wasn’t until the 1970s, at the height of Women’s Lib, that wives began holding their husbands to the same sexual expectation. “Back then, that was progress,” she said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Today, a new sexual ethos in marriage seems imminent—one, perhaps, that will allow us to fully individuate from our spouses in rooms of our own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbGFugHN9jqmpoq6RmMZutc1mpJqqop6uqLGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
