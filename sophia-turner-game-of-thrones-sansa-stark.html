I was always like, ‘Okay, and then there’s gonna be a point where she finally uses everything — all of that knowledge that she’s soaked up — and uses it to her advantage.'”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Turner also revealed how she landed the role of Sansa on the HBO drama, explaining that she tried out for the part when Thrones‘ nationwide casting search came to her school and her drama teacher, “just threw in me with a bunch of my other friends and we all auditioned together.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I didn’t know HBO, I didn’t know Game of Thrones, I didn’t know George R.R. Martin — I barely knew what TV was,” she said. “My mom woke me up one morning and was like, ‘Good morning, Sansa.’ I woke up and was like, [in disbelief] ‘No!!!’ and just started crying. It was a really good day.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Listen to the full podcast at <a href=# rel=noopener>hollywoodreporter.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtbGJtgneFjqymqaCZlnq1wdGnnKtll5a6pnnOn2StoKKku6a%2FjKyYp6uRYsC1rdGkZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
