But it was Maria Sharapova who confirmed that they could have it all  if they worked really, really hard. She won Wimbledon at 17, went on to take titles at the U.S. Open and Australian Open and earned the No. 1 ranking on four occasions. Ferociously determined, her credibility as an athlete forms the basis of her huge commercial success. According to <i>Forbes</i>, Sharapova, now 24 years old, pocketed $24.5 million in 2010  more than any other female athlete. In January 2010, Nike extended its sponsorship deal with Sharapova for eight more years, for a total of $70 million  the most lucrative deal ever for a sportswoman. She’s no longer the wide-eyed teen who won Wimbledon in 2004  and that would make a victory in 2011 even more significant. As she says, “my win at Wimbledon at age 17 was something very special for me and my family. But if I were to win Wimbledon for a second time after coming back from a very tough shoulder surgery, that would have to be my greatest win.”</p><p><a href=# class=see>See Maria Sharapova’s favorite travel tips.</a></p><ul class="full-list group col-1"><li class=item-list><h3>Wimbledon Women</h3></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijlZq9qrrGrJqoqpVjr627xqxlraGdmnuku8xoaWlpYWR9d3uRa2ZsaF2hsqixzZ2qZqeWYsSwucSnqmaslaO7qr%2BMqZisrF2lv6a%2FxKerZpmemXqnwdOuqZ5no6G2pbGOppiroZFiwKmt0ZqnqK6RZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
