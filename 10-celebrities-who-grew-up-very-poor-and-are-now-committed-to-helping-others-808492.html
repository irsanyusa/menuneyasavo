Here are 10&nbsp;celebrities who came from very little and were able to&nbsp;become major stars thanks to&nbsp;their talent and hard work.</p><p><h2>Cameron Diaz</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/89b/6df/267236594494cf2a4fe5201b96.jpg><p>face to face/FaceToFace/REPORTER/East News</p><p>The 49-year-old <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actress</a> revealed that she had ’’amazing parents’’ and a&nbsp;happy childhood, despite growing up&nbsp;with little money. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, “We&nbsp;weren’t privileged&nbsp;— very much the opposite. My&nbsp;family would collect (soda) cans to&nbsp;turn in&nbsp;for extra money.”</p><p>Diaz added that the way she grew up&nbsp;still affects her lifestyle to&nbsp;this day. She said, “I&nbsp;come from a&nbsp;frugal upbringing, so&nbsp;I’m not just going to&nbsp;throw my&nbsp;money away.” However, when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;those in&nbsp;need, Cameron is&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>help</a>. She has participated in&nbsp;multiple charitable events and has even started her own foundation called <i>Begin Today for Tomorrow, </i>in&nbsp;2001, which supports various causes.</p><p><h2>Tom Cruise</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f09/596/49b30a5545b2b8c1ff2e6fa089.jpg><p>JMHAEDRICH/JPPARIENTE/SIPA/SIPA/East News</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>He</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;indeed one of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>’s most hard-working and successful actors of&nbsp;his time. And working was something that Cruise had to&nbsp;get familiar with at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very early age. The star <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, ’’I’ve always had a&nbsp;work ethic.’’ He&nbsp;added, ’’I’ve had paying jobs since&nbsp;I was about 8&nbsp;years old&nbsp;— cutting grass, raking leaves, paper routes, selling Easter cards and Christmas cards.’’</p><p>After reaching success, the 60-year-old has certainly been paying it&nbsp;forward with charity work. This includes <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>donating</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;neglected rural community in&nbsp;Africa and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>raising</a> money for a&nbsp;children’s charity.</p><p><h2>Mila Kunis</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ff/db8/109a515390b5a4bb883344a01b.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>The 38-year-old <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actress</a> emigrated with her family to&nbsp;the United States as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child.

She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> that they make sure to&nbsp;not splurge just because they now have the means&nbsp;to, adding, ’’we both are very much self-made and are very aware of&nbsp;what a&nbsp;dollar is&nbsp;worth.’’</p><p>After making it&nbsp;big in&nbsp;Hollywood, the actress uses her power to&nbsp;support causes and people in&nbsp;need. For example, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>became</a> the Global Brand Ambassador for a&nbsp;company involving ethical mining in&nbsp;Africa.</p><p><h2>Jennifer Lopez</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6bf/a71/8ea1625619a3dbdb4c622ed67e.jpg><p>She is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the biggest stars of&nbsp;our time, but <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>J.&nbsp;Lo</a>&nbsp;had to&nbsp;struggle before reaching her star status.
