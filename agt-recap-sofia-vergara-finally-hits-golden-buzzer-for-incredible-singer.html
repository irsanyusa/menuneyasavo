The night ended with an audition the judges definitely weren’t expecting.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sofia-vergara-hits-agt-golden-buzzer-for-gabriel-henrique>Sofia Vergara Hits AGT Golden Buzzer for Gabriel Henrique</h2><p>It feels like we’ve been waiting forever to see Sofia Vergara hit the Golden Buzzer this season. Considering her Golden Buzzer for Season 17 (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dance group the Mayyas</a>) went on to win the show, we really wanted to see who Vergara would choose this year.</p><p>The honor ended up going to Gabriel Henrique, a singer from Brazil who talked to the judges with the help of an interpreter. The panel could tell he was nervous before he started performing, but he ended up delivering a stunning performance of “Run to You” by Whitney Houston.</p><p>Gabriel showed off an incredible vocal range, hitting notes that would make Mariah Carey jealous. Vergara told him that she didn’t “have words” to describe how talented he is. She showed Gabriel just how impressed she was by hitting the Golden Buzzer and sending him straight to the live shows.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MEET BRAZILIAN TIKTOK SINGER WITH A STUNNING RANGE, GABRIEL HENRIQUE</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-howie-mandel-gets-booed-during-kylie-frey-s-audition>Howie Mandel Gets Booed During Kylie Frey’s Audition</h3><p>During Tuesday’s episode of AGT, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rodeo queen Kylie Frey</a> took the stage with her band to sing an original song she wrote for her late grandfather called “Horses in Heaven.” Simon Cowell was impressed, calling Kylie “the real deal.”</p><p>However, Howie Mandel didn’t agree. He said the song didn’t move him, and it didn’t get stuck in his head like he expects a good song to do. The audience (along with Cowell) booed Mandel for his critique of Kylie’s performance. Fortunately for Kylie, the other judges all voted “yes” to sending her through.</p><p>The night also featured a few other impressive musical acts, including 19-year-old singer Summer Rios, who was so excited to get four “yes” votes that she fell over backstage. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">animated dog Bun</a> also received four “yes” votes for his performance. Then there was the rock band True Villains, who entertained the panel with their cover of “Bad Guy” by Billie Eilish.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-singer-sunny-chatum-shocks-the-judges>Singer Sunny Chatum Shocks the Judges</h3><p>Tuesday night’s new episode of AGT ended with an audition from singer Sunny Chatum, who shared that he was inspired to start playing the ukulele after he watched Grace VanderWaal compete on AGT. The only problem was that Sunny took forever to start singing.</p><p>After showing the judges his dream board and asking them to help him pick a song, Sunny started getting red buzzers. Heidi Klum was the last to hit hers, as she demanded he sing. When all the buzzers had been hit, Sunny revealed his true identity.</p><p>The singer removed his mustache and introduced himself as Krista Komondor, a female comedian from Brooklyn. The panel was in shock, with Howie Mandel comparing Krista to late comedian Andy Kaufman. She received three “yes” votes to move on. Unfortunately, Klum wasn’t impressed.</p><p>What was your favorite audition from Tuesday night’s new episode? Do you agree with Vergara’s choice to hit the Golden Buzzer for Gabriel Henrique?
