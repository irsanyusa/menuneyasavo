While his recent history may not fully capture the depth of&nbsp;his experiences, understanding his <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a> undoubtedly elicits empathy and admiration.</p><p>Back in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1970s</a>, Reeves and his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> went through a&nbsp;tough journey to&nbsp;escape the violence and uncertainty, they were dealing with in&nbsp;Lebanon. But it&nbsp;wasn’t all smooth sailing&nbsp;— his father, Samuel Nowlin Reeves, decided to&nbsp;leave them behind, which was a&nbsp;heartbreaking challenge for the young actor, leaving a&nbsp;lasting impact on&nbsp;how he&nbsp;perceives family.</p><p>Growing up&nbsp;wasn’t easy for him since he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;deal with three different stepfathers. School was a&nbsp;struggle too because he&nbsp;had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dyslexia</a> and had to&nbsp;switch to&nbsp;four different schools.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b38/544/17cc635f6e8a49cc9063b765d6.jpg><p>Chris Pizzello/Invision/East News</p><p>After all that, they finally settled in&nbsp;Toronto, where Reeves had to&nbsp;face the trials and tribulations of&nbsp;growing up&nbsp;without his dad. It&nbsp;had a&nbsp;significant impact on&nbsp;Reeves. He&nbsp;has openly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talked</a> about how it&nbsp;affected him in&nbsp;various ways.<strong> “No, the story with me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;dad’s pretty heavy. It’s full of&nbsp;pain and woe.”</strong></p><p>Despite the absence of&nbsp;his father, Reeves has come to&nbsp;terms with the fact that his dad chose a&nbsp;different path and decided not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;their family’s life. On&nbsp;the other hand, Samuel, his father, acknowledged that he&nbsp;knows what his son is&nbsp;up&nbsp;to, and he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>declared</a>, “I&nbsp;pretty much know what he’s doing, <strong>but he’s made it&nbsp;clear that he&nbsp;wants nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with&nbsp;me</strong>.”</p><p><h2>Keanu has a&nbsp;deep and close relationship with his mother.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0be/bc0/c5bc905014bdef6bd31dd69724.jpg><p>Keanu last saw his father when he&nbsp;was&nbsp;13, and he&nbsp;recalls those last moments, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “On&nbsp;our last day we&nbsp;sat on&nbsp;the veranda and stared at&nbsp;the dark sky. He&nbsp;hardly said anything that evening. The next day he&nbsp;brought&nbsp;us to&nbsp;the airport. <strong>Then we&nbsp;didn’t hear anything from him for 10&nbsp;years.</strong> <strong>No&nbsp;calls, no&nbsp;letters, nothing.</strong>”</p><p>Despite everything, Reeves pushed forward and became the successful actor we&nbsp;know today. Other than this he&nbsp;had been able to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;strong bond with his mom, finding solace and closeness in&nbsp;her. Taylor, his mom, has been a&nbsp;constant presence by&nbsp;her son’s side, and their bond is&nbsp;reportedly very strong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f5/56e/5153d85dc19cdb963630e752b0.jpg><p>Reeves openly displays the affection and connection he&nbsp;shares with his mom. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;heartwarming gesture, he&nbsp;brought her as&nbsp;his date to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2020</a> Academy Awards, a&nbsp;night usually filled with glamorous and famous couples.</p><p>As&nbsp;the red carpet glowed with stars and elegance, Reeves decided to&nbsp;honor the person who means so&nbsp;much to&nbsp;him, his mother, by&nbsp;having her as&nbsp;his plus-one. With pride and style, the actor confidently walked the red carpet, dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;sleek suit that perfectly complemented his mother’s outfit.</p><p>While his relationship with his father might have been distant, the love and closeness Keanu shares with his mother stand as&nbsp;a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;the strength of&nbsp;family bonds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/84d/ab8/9e8b1e5543a6eabc00e50d9c41.jpg><p>LGjr-RG, PacificCoastNews/EAST NEWS</p><p>For a&nbsp;long time, Keanu lived in&nbsp;hotels and short-term rental places as&nbsp;a&nbsp;grown-up. But as&nbsp;he&nbsp;got closer to&nbsp;40, he&nbsp;felt it&nbsp;was time to&nbsp;settle down and have a&nbsp;permanent home. But that’s not all&nbsp;— he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something special for the person who had been there for him his whole life: his mom.</p><p>With lots of&nbsp;love and gratitude, Keanu did something big. He&nbsp;not only <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bought</a> a&nbsp;home for himself but also got one for his mom. He&nbsp;knew how much she sacrificed for him and how much she loved him unconditionally. So, he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;show his appreciation in&nbsp;a&nbsp;big way. His mom now has a&nbsp;place to&nbsp;call her own in&nbsp;Los Angeles, a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;his love and thankfulness for everything she did for him.</p><p>Keanu is&nbsp;not only an&nbsp;incredible actor but also an&nbsp;amazing person, and besides his close relationship with his mom, he&nbsp;shares a&nbsp;special bond with his <a href=#>sister</a>.</p><p>Preview photo credit LGjr-RG, PacificCoastNews/EAST NEWS<span>, </span>Amy Harris/Invision/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLimrc2uZKudlauytHnWmqpmmZKWu6W7zZ6bZpqpYrWqv4yfmK2glad6osCMqKWlsV1oerqxwKuqZqecmXqiusNmoK1lmaK9oq%2FTnptmoJmoeri0zqWcZqSZm7JuhJBtanBvXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
