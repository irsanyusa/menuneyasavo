The “Dark Horse” singer dropped a joke on stage, signifying her disappointment over the mediocre success of her last two albums.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you couldn’t love me in my Witness and Smile eras, then you can’t love me in my KP6 era,” she said.</p><p>Donning a yellow and orange glittery dress with cut-outs, Perry did a sassy hip swivel as she made the announcement. KP6 will mark the hitmaker’s first album release since 2020.</p><p>Perry seems pretty much confident with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KP6</a>, guessing based on her playful teaser. Indeed, it’s high time the pop singer claim another commercial grand slam after Witness and Smile failed to reach expectations.</p><p>Witness managed to hit No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. However, it only had one top 10 hit with “Chained to the Rhythm.” Smile, on the other hand, only peaked at No. 5 for one week and didn’t produce any top 10 hits at all. Such were huge letdowns on Perry’s part, as her first three albums have all been extremely famous.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite so, Perry’s popularity didn’t drop, still getting recognized as one of the sought-after pop stars of her generation. Even when she’s not busy putting out songs, her schedule has remained packed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“If you couldn’t love me in my ‘Witness’ and ‘Smile’ eras, then you can’t love me in my KP6 era.”</p><p>— Katy Perry yesterday at <a href=#>#PLAY</a> residency.</p><p><a href=#>https://t.co/CV5JZ6PWnr</a></p>— Katy Perry Today (@todaykatyp) <a href=#>August 10, 2023</a></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Says Her Daughter Daisy will be the First to Hear Her New Songs</h2><p>Although the singer hasn’t released any studio albums since welcoming her daughter with longtime boyfriend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Orlando Bloom</a>, she’s clarified that she never really slept on songwriting. Even though she’s taken the time to dive into motherhood, she hasn’t said goodbye to her singing/songwriting career.</p><p>“I’m always writing, I have been, but I think what’s really important to me is to be celebrating the world that I’ve got to build with all of these wonderful songs and to be responsible for a life for a 3-year-old,” she said. “I will be back, but let me get this right.”</p><p>Confessing she’s “written a lot from a place of love,” Perry’s next release is a product of the “unconditional love” she’s been receiving. When she’s all ready to release new music, Perry said that Daisy will be the first to listen.&nbsp;</p><p>“Daisy always gets the first look,” she said. “Whatever music I am writing, I play it to her and see how she loves it.”<br>Perry’s PLAY residency will run until November at the Resorts World Theatre at Resorts World Las Vegas.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_Lizzo_Timothy-NorrisFilmMagic-220x147.jpg alt="Lizzo Reportedly Dropped from Super Bowl Halftime Show Consideration" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>katy perry</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57ypqrsmWgmr%2BzxYytnJqrlah6rLyVZpyrmV2WuqqwjKWYrGWmmrSiv4yrnKyhlJq7pMWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
