Phoebe Atwood Taylor, 42, writer of mystery chillers with a Cape Cod setting (Deadly Sunshade); and Dr. Grantley Walder Taylor, 54, Boston physician; she for the first, he for the second time; in Providence.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Married. Marriner S. Eccles, 61, Utah banker and sound-currency chairman of the Federal Reserve System’s board of governors from 1936 until President Truman demoted him in 1948, and one of the architects of New Deal finance; and Mrs. Sara Madison Classic, 43, of Chevy Chase, Md.; both for the second time; in Manhattan.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Died. Victor Alexander John Hope, 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow, 64, Viceroy of India for a record 6½ years (1936-43); of coronary thrombosis while shooting game on his estate near South Queensferry, Scotland. An old-fashioned peer who believed that the aristocracy has responsibilities as well as privileges, Lord Linlithgow distinguished himself as a soldier (commander of a Royal Scots battalion in World War I), politician (deputy chairman of Scotland’s Conservative Party), businessman (chairman of Midland Bank) and educator (Chancellor of Edinburgh University). As Viceroy of India, he faced with frosty courage his double troubles of constitutional changes and organizing the country for war: he jailed Gandhi and Nehru, suspended the constitution he had helped bring to India, organized an army of 2,000,000, administered what Churchill called “a glorious final page in the story of our Indian Empire.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Died. Joseph (“Jo”) Davidson, 68, bearded portrait sculptor of celebrities (Madame Chiang Kaishek, D. H. Lawrence, Lloyd George, F.D.R., Gandhi, Mussolini), sometime political dabbler (cochairman of the Progressive Citizens of America in 1947, co-chairman of the Wallace-for-President Committee in 1948) ; of a heart attack; in Tours, France. Born of Russian-Jewish immigrants on Manhattan’s lower East Side, Davidson began as a newsboy. In 1907 he headed for Europe with a $40 stake to study art. Since 1910 he had shuttled busily and profitably between the U.S. and Europe. His most important commission: bronze busts of World War I’s allied leaders. Davidson’s own bland explanation of success: “It’s not talent that counts, it’s the driving energy.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Died. Maxim Litvinoff, 75, onetime Soviet Foreign Commissar (1929-39) and Ambassador to the U.S. (1941-43); in Moscow (see FOREIGN NEWS).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Died. William Adolf Irvin, 78, onetime railroad freight agent who rose through the ranks to become president of U.S. Steel Corp. (1932-38), helped organize and became chairman of the National Safety Council; after long illness; in Manhattan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmaaqpOdtrexjm9taXBlbINwucilnKysn6OytHnJmqVmaWRifnqBkWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
