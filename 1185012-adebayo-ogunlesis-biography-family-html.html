Today, he’s a head of a division of the Credit Suisse First, which is located in Boston. Now, he’s leading a team of 1,200 bankers and supervises assets of almost $3 billion.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Snoop Dogg biography</p><p class=align-left>Adebayo Ogunlesi’s father was a professor of medicine in Nigeria. In 1970s, Adebayo took a trip to England and entered the Oxford University. He wanted to study economics and politics. After the completion of a Bachelor’s degree (received with honors), Ogunlesi went into further education in Harvard. There, he entered the Law School and, except him, there were only two other foreigners in the class.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/679513831cd3eb12.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>From Nigeria to Italy: Nigerian boy, 16, picked by an Italian firm as a senior web developer, gets celebrated</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The school has such rules: they don’t like accepting foreigners but it was a lucky occasion for Adebayo that he was admitted. While there, Adebayo and another guy from his group became the first ever Africans to edit the Harvard Law Review.</p><p class=align-left>Now, it’s curious enough to hear that at that time Adebayo had a kind of irrational fear of numbers. This is why he entered Harvard Business School at the same time while he was studying law. He expected that studying finance and other related disciplines would overcome his fear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/679513831cd3eb12.jpeg><p class=align-left>In the meanwhile, he completed law and received a Master’s degree in 1979. This was a push for his career for in a while, he became a clerk for a judge serving in the US Supreme Court. This was a great exception, too, because there had never been any non-American clerks occupying this position ever in history.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/71d5c4be6173e8ff.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>I sought opportunities abroad because Nigeria rejected me - Man living in Europe opens company in UK</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Three years later, Adebayo made a career movement and became a part of a known law firm in New York. He has been working there as an intern for only nine months when the bank called him to work for them. The point why the bank chose him was quite simple: a man who knew Adebayo personally in Nigeria recommended him to the bank that was cooperating with the Nigerian government at that time.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Actress Kemi Afolabi biography and family</p><h2>A huge turn in Adebayo Ogunlesi's career</h2><p class=align-left>At first, the bank claimed that it was borrowing the precious employee for no more than three months.
