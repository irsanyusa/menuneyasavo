This is Shelton’s ninth win in 22 seasons, as he prepares to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">depart the show next year</a>.</strong></p><p>Shelton had three artists in the Top 5, and two of them made it into the Top 3. During Tuesday’s finale, host Carson Daly announced that Brayden Lape (Team Blake) came in fifth place, while Omar Jose Cardona (Team Legend) came in fourth. It wasn’t clear whether Bodie (Team Blake) or Morgan Myles (Team Camila) was the runner-up.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>🚨🚨 SPOILER ALERT 🚨🚨<br>we've got <a href=#>#thevoice</a> winner !!!!!! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hE99bTjXDs</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>December 14, 2022</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bryce-leatherwood-named-the-voice-season-22-winner>Bryce Leatherwood Named The Voice Season 22 Winner</h2><p>Throughout the season, Bryce has personified country music. On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Monday night</a>, he performed “Don’t Close Your Eyes” by Keith Whitley and “Trouble” by Elvis Presley. Shelton told him that he “ignited a fire in country music fans,” and he apparently did.</p><p>Before being named the winner, the 22-year-old thanked his coach and called his time on The Voice “the greatest experience I’ve had in my life.” He also took the stage with Shelton during Tuesday’s finale to perform Shelton’s own song “Hillbilly Bone.”</p><p>Shelton was a busy man during the two-hour finale, as he took the stage for four different performances. He sang duets with his other two artists Brayden Lape and Bodie, performing “Chasin’ That Neon Rainbow” by Alan Jackson and his own track “God’s Country.” He also performed with country star Kane Brown.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BLAKE SHELTON TALKS DEEP ABOUT ‘THE VOICE’ EXIT, PRIORITIZING GWEN STEFANI, STEPSONS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelly-clarkson-girl-named-tom-returned-to-the-stage>Kelly Clarkson, Girl Named Tom Returned to the Stage</h3><p>Tuesday’s finale also featured performances from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">last year’s winners Girl Named Tom</a>, as well as their coach Kelly Clarkson. Clarkson will be returning to the show for Season 23 along with Shelton and new coaches Chance the Rapper and Niall Horan.</p><p>Clarkson took a festive approach to her performance by singing her song “Santa, Can’t You Hear Me” off her album When Christmas Comes Around… Meanwhile, Girl Named Tom returned one year after taking home the Season 21 trophy to perform “One More Christmas” from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">their EP of the same name</a>.</p><p>Coaches John Legend and Camila Cabello also performed duets with their artists during Tuesday’s show. Legend and Omar joined forces to sing “Signed, Sealed, Delivered I’m Yours” by Stevie Wonder, while Cabello and Morgan sang the coach’s song “Never Be the Same.”</p><p>We also got to see some funny moments from the coaches, as Gwen Stefani tried to steal the show’s trophy for her husband, Cabello went to America’s Got Talent <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">judge Howie Mandel</a> for comedy tips, and Shelton and Legend starred in their very own sitcom.</p><p>Do you agree with the winner of The Voice Season 22?
