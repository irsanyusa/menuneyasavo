It’s crazy how bad things were then or so we thought.. things are bad now, like really really bad right now, it’s awful. For the love of God, can our leaders please act right & come through for us one time, this one time pleaseeeee?"</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He wrote, "For those that are new to what’s going on, Nigeria is currently undergoing the worst economic downturn, & inflation is at its highest point in over 30 years, as a result there is so much hunger in the land."</p><p>"All we are asking for is a better standard of living; we just want to eat & get from point A to point B at an affordable & reasonable price; we don’t care who or what is ruling over whom, we need help & we need it now; we have gone from sitting to dancing on a keg of gunpowder," said the actor.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ad3fdd62-26b4-4084-9f8e-a8878d72e5fe data-caption="#EndBadGovernment protesters, in Ikeja to Ojota, Lagos, Nigeria, on Thursday, August 1, 2024.

Well! We are asking for a drastic reduction in electricity tariffs, & fuel prices. Among other things, a reduction of the foreign exchange rate to the Naira. These factors affect the average Nigerian drastically & impact greatly on our day-to-day activity," said the actor.</p><p>He pleaded, "Please, Mr. President, do something, this is the one time you can write your name in the sands of time, pleeeeeeeeease I am begging, they are begging, we are all begging. I guess what the kids in the photo & I are trying to say is, if you’re not going to give us a chance to lead, then lead us well,"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGawnaKaeqK%2FyqKloGWWpL9ursStq56qXajBorrDmqmdq12ks264yK%2Bgp59dlrmmxNdmnKStkqR6tbuMraCnrZKqfLq6w25soao%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
