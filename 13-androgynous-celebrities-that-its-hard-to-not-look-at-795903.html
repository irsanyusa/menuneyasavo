There are more and more famous androgynous people and movie directors that experiment with creating these different characters."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Many androgynous people think that they’re somewhere in&nbsp;the middle between a&nbsp;man and a&nbsp;woman. Celebrities that have such appearances are like chameleons in&nbsp;that they can easily become a&nbsp;character of&nbsp;the opposite sex or&nbsp;transform into a&nbsp;fantasy character without using a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;makeup. Additionally, fashion trends of&nbsp;today are great for androgynous people because unisex pieces are becoming more and more popular.</p><p>There are more and more famous androgynous people and movie directors that experiment with creating these different characters. We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have made a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;androgynous people that have won the hearts of&nbsp;fans not only with their talent but also with their rare attractiveness.</p><p><h2>1. Tilda Swinton</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ce1/2a8/1b01775778b30b003957778397.jpg><p>Tilda Swinton is&nbsp;the master of&nbsp;transformation. Her pale skin is&nbsp;perfect to&nbsp;play a&nbsp;vampire, her unusual face can play a&nbsp;wizard, and her androgyny can help her transform into a&nbsp;man on&nbsp;the outside. Directors trust Swinton with the most complex characters that not every actress would agree to&nbsp;portray. And her fans always expect the unexpected from her.</p><p><h2>2. Bill Kaulitz</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5fa/201/c311ff5c8c9a5b99acf5bdb73b.jpg><p><a href=#>Tokio Hotel</a> frontman Bill Kaulitz became famous back at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the 2000s. Kaulitz’s image was so&nbsp;controversial that many people thought he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;girl. With hair that looked like a&nbsp;skunk tail along with his bright eyes and cute face, he&nbsp;became quite popular. But even today, he&nbsp;surprises people with his appearance thanks to&nbsp;his outfits and makeup. The <a href=# title=musician data-link=tag>musician</a> also has a&nbsp;twin brother whose appearance didn’t stop him from becoming Heidi Klum’s husband.</p><p><h2>3. Cillian Murphy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7aa/491/c6fcd95ac8879dc4d4a5a3d9a3.jpg><p>Critics say that Cillian Murphy is&nbsp;a&nbsp;chameleon. And there’s a&nbsp;good reason for this: he&nbsp;can easily transform into a&nbsp;transgendered person or&nbsp;an&nbsp;attractive, maniac terrorist. With bright eyes that any girl would love to&nbsp;possess along with his prominent cheekbones and plump lips, he’s always been a&nbsp;great choice for any of&nbsp;the movie roles he’s had in&nbsp;the past.</p><p><h2>4. Glenn Close</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d82/b10/2323685f53965630facdb0d4b6.jpg><p>The children that grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the ’90s remember Cruella De&nbsp;Vil. This is&nbsp;the role that made this actress very popular. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;different film, she portrayed a&nbsp;girl that pretended to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;man. Some people think that Close looks a&nbsp;lot like the late actor, Robin Williams. We&nbsp;agree that this is&nbsp;close to&nbsp;the truth.</p><p><h2>5. David Bowie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b78/a27/afd5f9568f98d3428a3a0b6651.jpg><p>The extravagant <a href=# title="David Bowie" data-link=tag>David Bowie</a> loved to&nbsp;wear androgynous looks with the help of&nbsp;bright makeup, women’s dresses, and high-heeled shoes. His over-the-top behavior also made the image more unusual. This is&nbsp;why Bowie didn’t look like anyone else and became a&nbsp;legend in&nbsp;the music world. And in&nbsp;2013, he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;video for his song, “<a href=#>The Stars (Are Out Tonight)</a>” with androgynous models and actress Tilda Swinton.</p><p><h2>6. Gwendoline Christie</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/307/fad/8744265155b2628eb6a1070533.jpg><p>Many people know Gwendoline Christie from Game of&nbsp;Thrones. In&nbsp;her real life, she looks just as&nbsp;impressive: she stands tall at&nbsp;over 6&nbsp;feet, has pale skin, light hair, and bold facial features.</p><p><h2>7. Timothée Chalamet</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc0/56d/996b0c5b06b124d4fd254a0a2a.jpg><p>The young and attractive Timothée Chalamet became famous after he&nbsp;<a href=#>portrayed</a> a&nbsp;teenager that fell in&nbsp;love with a&nbsp;man. His aristocratic, feminine face and his amazing acting talent and charisma made him a&nbsp;rising <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> star. Fans have expressed their feelings in&nbsp;an&nbsp;Instagram-<a href=#>account</a> where they add him to&nbsp;different pieces of&nbsp;<a href=# title=art data-link=tag>art</a>.</p><p><h2>8. Lady Gaga</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c3/334/100c585c4baaa6bc13dec3c630.jpg><p><a href=# title="Lady Gaga" data-link=tag>Lady Gaga</a> has said many times in&nbsp;her interviews that she doesn’t think that she’s a&nbsp;man or&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman. She has a&nbsp;male stage image&nbsp;— strong Italian, Jo&nbsp;Calderone. The singer has said that David Bowie had a&nbsp;huge impact on&nbsp;her art, so&nbsp;she wears his portrait on&nbsp;her body.</p><p><h2>9. Charlotte Gainsbourg</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d53/f6b/cdfbeb507ab104ba277d0a691b.jpg><p>The unusual and even sharp facial features of&nbsp;Charlotte Gainsbourg always create an&nbsp;unusual image in&nbsp;movies. This is&nbsp;probably the reason why director Lars von Trier likes this actress so&nbsp;much. She loves wearing men’s clothes, doesn’t use a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;makeup, and sometimes doesn’t even comb her hair.</p><p><h2>10. Jared Leto</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/569/c11/94614a5c7181449b51e78833c2.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jared Leto" data-link=tag>Jared Leto</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;talented actor and musician. He&nbsp;has long hair, blue eyes, and a&nbsp;cute yet feminine-looking face. These features allow him to&nbsp;portray very different characters like the one he&nbsp;played in&nbsp;Dallas Buyers Club, for example. In&nbsp;his everyday life, he&nbsp;doesn’t hide his femininity: he&nbsp;often uses nail polish, mascara, and more. He&nbsp;also may become a&nbsp;real-life Dorian Gray because he’s 48&nbsp;years old but looks as&nbsp;if&nbsp;he’s 25.</p><p><h2>11. Zoe Kravitz</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c0/d2d/6b23bb56138de2fbcb6965736a.jpg><p>The daughter of&nbsp;Lenny Kravitz, Zoe Kravitz, has an&nbsp;unusual appearance just like her father. She is&nbsp;pretty short and has a&nbsp;haircut that makes her look like a&nbsp;cute teenager. But this wasn’t a&nbsp;problem when she needed to&nbsp;portray a&nbsp;very sensitive character in&nbsp;Big Little Lies and become the face of&nbsp;Black Opium for YSL.</p><p><h2>12. Eddie Redmayne</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/baa/5b3/1daeef537fb2924649e544b56d.jpg><p>These female facial features allowed Eddie Redmayne to&nbsp;portray the plausible transformation of&nbsp;a&nbsp;man that decided to&nbsp;change his sex. Redmayne had to&nbsp;lose about 15&nbsp;pounds for the role.</p><p><h2>13. LP&nbsp;(Laura Pergolizzi)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e5/8ad/b55dd9508cbfe09eb525b63bbe.jpg><p>Laura Pergolizzi is&nbsp;a&nbsp;singer known under the name LP. She became famous after the release of&nbsp;the song, “<a href=#>Lost on&nbsp;You</a>” that instantly became a&nbsp;hit and received 300 million views. Few people managed to&nbsp;guess who was singing it&nbsp;and couldn’t tell if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;guy or&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl. And after the video, it&nbsp;was still not very clear. A&nbsp;low-pitched voice, sharp facial features, a&nbsp;boy-like body, curly hair, and men’s clothes make&nbsp;LP of&nbsp;the most famous androgynous celebrities.</p><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;her interviews, she said that she had plenty of&nbsp;situations when people thought she was a&nbsp;guy. One time, some women thought she’d snuck into the ladies’ room and tried to&nbsp;make her leave. And LP&nbsp;just smiled and told them that she was a&nbsp;girl.</p><p>If&nbsp;you were a&nbsp;movie director, what role would you give to&nbsp;an&nbsp;androgynous person?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH50ecCnm6unl667sMHSZpqepJWXv6rAyJ6qZqyYlsFutdOsZKGZopl6tbuMp6atZZykvKx5wK1kcHFlbn10ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
