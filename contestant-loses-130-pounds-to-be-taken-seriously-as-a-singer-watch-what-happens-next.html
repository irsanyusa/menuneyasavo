Pressure must be high while sitting among hundreds of other hopefuls in the holding area awaiting your audition. Let alone if you make it to Hollywood, the pressure only grows each step closer to the finale. For Lindita Halimi however, there was an added pressure. Fat-shamed as a teen, she felt she had to lose some weight to make it as a singer. And “some” sounds modest for the nearly 150 lbs. she managed to shed.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fed-up-with-the-fat-shaming>Fed Up With The Fat-Shaming</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_ehpNig7P0</p>Lindita Halimi’s inspiring audition</figure><p>Lindita Halimi had been singing in her native Kosovo before moving to the US in 2013. In Europe, she had already gained fame after winning the singing competition&nbsp;<a href=#>Top Fest in 2009</a>. She was often praised and recognized as having a great voice, but the public would often comment on her weight. At one point Lindita’s 5’4″ frame reached a weight of 250 lbs.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED: <a href=# class=broken_link>WATCH WORLD’S YOUNGEST DJ EVER BRINGS THE BIGGEST PARTY TO THE STAGE ON ‘AGT: CHAMPIONS’</a></strong></p><p>Lindita didn’t mind her self-image until the weight began to present issues to her health. Then one day on the train, a woman mistook an 18-year-old Lindita for being pregnant and offered up her seat. This was the moment she decided to begin her weight loss journey.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" readability=5><p>https://www.tiktok.com/@linditaworld/video/6920729195467296006?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowUjzerVlKXwWj0LoBltUKgugdG2gneLX90WTo2EatYr%2FnPdP92ujoeOWHdCSc3UF0GgA%3D&language=en&sec_uid=MS4wLjABAAAAneqBQtYHB2vAqI-VDPU2thqWUn0MJhVruJP0DYfaFQHGfL6OAqJmg6VG4wCT5p33&sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAneqBQtYHB2vAqI-VDPU2thqWUn0MJhVruJP0DYfaFQHGfL6OAqJmg6VG4wCT5p33&share_author_id=6567088474209648645&share_link_id=2F9DD4C6-BB9A-4FC9-9B96-E6527D569119&tt_from=copy&u_code=d0f7ifc5c16gj0&user_id=6567088474209648645&utm_campaign=client_share&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=copy&source=h5_m&is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6937035018859398661</p>Lindita shares her weight loss story on her TikTok</figure><p>She began researching weight loss tips and changed her diet accordingly, salmon and eggs being the main staples. When she moved to the states she began working with a personal trainer, who is now her husband. Her hard work paid off and within a few years, Lindita lost a total of 130 pounds!&nbsp;</p><p>She is now a personal trainer herself and hopes to help others on their weight loss journeys.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-inspiring-weight-loss-but-can-she-sing>Inspiring Weight Loss, But Can She Sing?</h3><p>Lindita had nailed her audition, singing “It’s A Man’s Man’s Man’s World” by James Brown. The judges were not expecting a voice like hers to come from the now petite personal trainer. The judges gave her 3 yeses to advance to Hollywood but <a href=#>stirred up a bit of controversy</a>. Misinterpreted compliments by J. Lo and Harry Connick Jr. riled up fans who recognized them as insensitive to the singer’s weight loss story.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Lindita only went on to make it to the Top 25 of the fifteenth and “final” season of the competition. Not winning&nbsp;Idol&nbsp;doesn’t at all speak to her talent. She was already accomplished in Europe and had collaborated with people like Stevie Wonder and Valerie Simpson before ever auditioning. Coming off her loss, she went on to represent Albania in the&nbsp;<a href=#>Eurovision Song Contest</a>&nbsp;the following year, after winning their national&nbsp;Festivali i Kenges.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Yet to release an album of her own, she continues to release original singles. If you want to hear her powerful voice check her out on Spotify and Apple Music. And if you ever need thinspiration or training tips, definitely go to her <a href=#>Instagram</a> and <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Claire-Crosby-Dave-Crosby-The-Voice-The-Ellen-DeGeneres-Show-Drivers-License.jpeg alt="WATCH Viral 8-Year-Old Sensation Claire Crosby Sing ‘Drivers License’ Better Than The Original" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqilrZ2jqa6vwIylpqydo2J%2BdHyMqaauppSoerW7jJucZqyRoLKvedKeqaKnpai5unnArGSaZaOeu6ix0WaumqyTnXq4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7%2BMp5yxrF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
