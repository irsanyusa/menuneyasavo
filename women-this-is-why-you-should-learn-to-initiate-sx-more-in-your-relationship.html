You need to learn to take the bull by the horn. And this is not something to begrudgingly do occasionally or once in a blue moon.</p><p>You have to become comfortable enough to do this as many times as possible.</p><p>One reason for this is that while men have no qualms making the moves on you for sex, it gets to a stage where they can’t decipher if you really want to do it, or if you are just doing it because they want to do it.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>And really, this could douse the sexual spark in that marriage or relationship. Sex is better when both partners have a confidence that that’s what the other person wants at that moment.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-dfede3a7-b636-4090-9fdf-0b64128bf4dd data-caption="If you want a relationship that not sexually one sided, you should know how to initiate sex with your partner.

It is mind-blowing for many when they are chased and openly desired.</p><p>So, when you leave sexy messages on the bathroom mirror about what awaits him in the bedroom later at night and actually make the move on him, it does a lot of good for that sex life of that relationship.</p><p>Again, covertly/actively asking for sex from your partner is good for his ego and the overall happiness in that relationship or marriage.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>While every woman is meant to know this, it is more important for women in relationships and marriages as it could be the difference between having a healthy sexual life and having one that’s lukewarm and boring.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR71qiknqZdqbWqv4yiqmavmK56urvUZqqhp6WhsW64xJqpp2WkpHqqusitoJqslWLAuXnMqKmeZZmjerq71Ktkq52clsGqu82sn6KoX2Wvd4PHo6c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
