Since the words for the seasons are all masculine in French, you might expect the same preposition to be used.&nbsp;</p><p>However, another factor comes into play: the first letter of the word. Three seasons out of four, namely été, automne and hiver, start with either a vowel or an h + vowel (the letter h is not pronounced in French). This is why the definite article is l’ rather than le for these three seasons, as you can see in our first table above.</p><p>This also impacts the preposition to be used, with printemps needing a different one from été, automne and hiver:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>French</strong></td><td><strong>English</strong></td></tr><tr><td>au printemps</td><td>in spring</td></tr><tr><td>en été</td><td>in summer</td></tr><tr><td>en automne</td><td>in fall</td></tr><tr><td>en hiver</td><td>in winter</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=A-few-expressions-involving-the-seasons-of-the-year-in-French>A few expressions involving the seasons of the year in French</h2><p>With the seasons setting the tempo of life, they are often used in expressions to describe the time of the year. Let’s look at a few common ones.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5 phrases to describe the various seasons in France</h3><p>Rather than using the actual words of the four seasons, a few expressions can
