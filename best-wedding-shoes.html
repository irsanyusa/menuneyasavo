For one, your wedding shoes. While many wedding gown designs feature a skirt that goes to the floor, which means you could perhaps get away with wearing <a rel=alternate href=#>flip-flops</a> as many brides have decided to do, you could end up throwing off the proportion of your dress (and tripping over your hem). Luckily, there are options for wedding shoes that are stylish yet comfortable enough for your important day.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-wedding-shoes>Our top picks for the best wedding shoes</h2><h3>Best budget wedding shoes: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Lulus Arylee White Ankle Strap Sandals</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best budget wedding shoes</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Arylee White Ankle Strap Heels</h3></p><p>For $39, these sleek, stylish, ankle strap heels can’t be beat. There’s a smooth, single-toe strap and a dainty ankle strap secured by a gold buckle. A rubber sole and a block heel make these a great choice for those who feel a bit unbalanced on spiked heels. A cushioned insole makes them comfortable throughout a wedding and reception—and easy to dance in. Shopping tip: Lulus made our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best places to buy a wedding dress online </a>and the <a rel=alternate href=#>best places to buy a dress online</a>.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: US 5-11</li><li>Heel height: 3.25-inch block</li><li>Material: Faux leather</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Simple and stylish</li><li>Great color choices</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Ankle strap fits a bit loosely</li></ul><h3>Most comfortable designer wedding shoes: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Jimmy Choo Romy Flat</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Most comfortable designer wedding shoes</span></p><p>These platinum ice dusty-glitter pointy-toe flats are the epitome of comfort, style, and grace in a delicate, clean silhouette—perfect for your inner ballerina. If you’re the bride or a member of the wedding party, these shoes will ensure you’re able to stay on your feet all day (or night) if needed. Even better? Long after your wedding, you’ll have plenty of reasons to wear them. These glittery shoes can even dress up a pair of jeans and a white t-shirt.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: US 4-13</li><li>Heel height: Flat</li><li>Material: Leather</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Glitter!</li><li>Comfortable</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Expensive (but then again, they’re Jimmy Choos)</li></ul><h3>Best "statement” designer wedding shoes: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Jimmy Choo Sacora 100 Beaded Heels</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best "statement” designer wedding shoes</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Jimmy Choo Sacora 100 Beaded Heels</h3></p><p>When you want to pull out all the stops (and why not?), turn to these elegant and glamorous, open-toe sandals from Jimmy Choo. Vintage-inspired, and made with satin and encrusted with pearls (with one logo-engraved large pearl in the center), these heels will stand out in any situation. Like all Jimmy Choo shoes, these are incredibly comfortable. They do run small, so be sure to size up a half size.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: US 4-13</li><li>Heel height: 3.9 inches</li><li>Material: Satin and leather</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Stunning pearl details</li><li>Good high heel height</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Very, very expensive</li><li>Runs small</li></ul><h3>Best flat wedding shoes: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Badgley Mischka Gigi Crystal Pointed Toe Flat</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best flat wedding shoes</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Badgley Mischka Gigi Crystal Pointed Toe Flat</h3></p><p>Another shoe for those who aren’t a fan of heels, or who just want to make sure they can dance and stand and mingle through an entire ceremony and reception without worrying about foot pain. Adorned with a beautiful array of crystals that catch the light, your feet will literally sparkle in these. We also love the scallop-shaped edge around the heel. Be aware that the very pointy toe could mean you need to size up.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: US 5–12, M and W</li><li>Heel height: Flat</li><li>Material: Satin and leather</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Comfortable</li><li>The style works beyond the wedding day</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Proper fit can be tricky due to pointed toe</li><li>Mesh and beaded details can rub against the foot (definitely break these in)</li></ul><h3>Best high-heeled wedding shoes: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Louboutin Jolie Queen</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best high-heeled wedding shoes</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Louboutin Jolie Queen</h3></p><p>Louboutin shoes are something you invest in when you want to make a statement. Every pair of Louboutins has a red-lacquered bottom and these crystal- encrusted stilettos are no exception. Delicate and strappy with a round, open toe, they convey and promote confidence and grace. Louboutins run small and narrow, so consider sizing up.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: US 7-11</li><li>Heel height: 4 inches</li><li>Material: Metallic leather, leather</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>A truly gorgeous statement shoe</li><li>True stiletto heel</li><li>Comfortable for a stiletto</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Very expensive</li><li>Limited availability</li></ul><h3>Best strappy-heel wedding shoes: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bella Belle Anita Illusion Lace Cross Strap Pump</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best strappy-heel wedding shoes</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Bella Belle Anita Illusion Lace Cross Strap Pump</h3></p><p>With a hand-sewn illusion net upper and delicate ivory lace, Bella Belle’s cross strap pumps are one of the more feminine and romantic pairs of shoes on our list. They have a pointy toe to elongate the legs and a tied bow at the heel for a secure fit. The 12-hour padding on the insole means they’re also super comfortable.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: US 5-11</li><li>Heel height: 4 inches</li><li>Material: Silk, mesh, leather</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Extra padding for comfort</li><li>Unique design</li><li>Designer quality without the four-figure price</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Ankle strap can feel a bit flimsy</li></ul><h3>Best mid-heel wedding shoes: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bella Belle Low Sling Back Beaded Heel</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best mid-heel wedding shoes</span></p><p><h3 class=title>ESTHER- Illusion Mesh Lace Beaded Kitten Heels with Removable Bow</h3></p><p>Like the other pair of Bella Belle shoes on this list, these have heavy padding on the insole for all-day comfort. They are a perfect mid-heel height with a closed toe and an elegant slingback. The combination of mesh, dainty beaded flowers, and fluffy bows work together to create a stunning show that compliments a variety of dresses. The tulle bow at the heel is removable.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: US 5-11</li><li>Heel height: 2.5 inches</li><li>Material: Silk, mesh, leather</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Heavy padding for comfort</li><li>Beautiful details</li><li>A high heel look at an easier-to-wear height</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>The big tulle bow may not be for everyone (but it's removable!)</li><li>Sling back style can often slide, depending on the shape of your foot/ankle</li></ul><h3>Best classic wedding shoes: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kate Spade Elodie Satin Bow Pumps</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best classic wedding shoes</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Kate Spade Elodie Satin Bow Pumps</h3></p><p>Kate Spade shoes receive high points when it comes to classic style and these satin bow shoes are no exception. The luxe satin bow is beautiful and tasteful with just the right amount of sweetness without coming off too “girly.” Quality-wise, these shoes are lined with 100% kid leather, which can stretch to fit your foot while adding a luxurious softness. These tend to run a half size big, so size down for a proper fit.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: US 5-11</li><li>Heel height: 4 inches</li><li>Material: Satin, kid leather</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Kid leather lining can stretch to fit your foot</li><li>Timeless style</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Runs large</li><li>You’ll need to break them in a bit before wearing</li></ul><h3>Best shoes for a beach wedding: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Reformation Eleonora Sling Back Block Sandals</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best shoes for a beach wedding</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Eleonora Sling Back Block Heel Sandal</h3></p><p>We know these aren’t white, but the subtle gold is the perfect accessory to add a bit of glam—especially if you’re wearing gold jewelry. The block heels are sturdy, on-trend, and probably your only choice for a heel that can work at the beach (though we wish they weren’t all-plastic). We love the 1970s vintage feel though, and they’re a versatile shoe for day to evening affairs. This style runs a bit narrow so if you have a wider foot, they may not work for you.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: US 5-11</li><li>Heel height: 2.5 inches</li><li>Material: Leather upper, plastic heel</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Gold tone is a subtle way to contrast wedding white</li><li>Block heel offers stability</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Plastic heel</li><li>Runs narrow</li></ul><h3>Best platform wedding shoes: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Stuart Weitzman Ryder 95 Platform Sandal</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best platform wedding shoes</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Stuart Weitzman Ryder 95 Platform Sandal, Adobe Beige Suede, Size: 9 Medium</h3></p><p>The Ryder Platform sandal is a sleek, minimalist, high- impact style that’s easy and comfortable to wear. Open-toed with an exposed back, they’re secured with a delicate ankle strap and buckle. The block heel and platform give you all the height you could want, while also offering more stability than a typical stiletto. From personal experience, I can attest that Stuart Weitzman platforms are super comfortable through hours of dancing and celebrating.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: US 4-12</li><li>Heel height: 4.9 inches, platform: 1.6 inches</li><li>Material: Leather upper and lining, leather/synthetic sole</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Platform offers stability</li><li>Versatile style that can be worn for other occasions</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>They’re very high, so you’ll have to factor in your dress length</li></ul><h3>Best wedding sneakers: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nike Air Force 1 07</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best wedding sneakers</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Nike Women's Air Force 1 '07 Shoes in White, Size: 11 | DD8959-100</h3></p><p>If you’re a sneaker person, there’s nothing that says you can’t wear a pair to your wedding. In fact, many people are going the clean, white athletic shoe route for formal occasions. The Nike Air Force 1 ’07 in white leather is both classic and timelessly stylish. These are low-cut sneakers with perforated holes on the toe box and a thick, sturdy sole.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: US 5-12</li><li>Heel height: Sneaker with a slight platform</li><li>Material: Leather</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Comfortable</li><li>Classic—and can be worn every day</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Runs large</li><li>You’ll have to consider your dress length so you don’t step on your hem</li><li>Stuffier relatives may have plenty to say</li></ul><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-wedding-shoes>How we selected the best wedding shoes</h2><p>I’m a journalist, as well as a tailor and pattern maker for film, television, fashion, and bridal. I had my own bridal alterations business in Austin, Texas where I had the honor of making countless brides look and feel their best. I’ve seen all manner and style of wedding shoes—as well as just shoes in general—from my 33 years in the costume and wardrobe worlds. I’ve known an extraordinary number of brides and have had many a conversation and debate about wedding shoes.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-wedding-shoes>What to consider when buying wedding shoes</h2><p>Wedding shoes have a lot of expectations to fulfill: They need to look sophisticated and sexy while also being practical—you want to be able to enjoy your day without screaming in pain. There are so many options available that you may not know where to start, but asking yourself these questions can help streamline your choices.</p><h3>What’s your budget?</h3><p>How much money you have set aside for your wedding shoes will give you an idea on where to start looking brand-wise. Designers that specialize in the wedding market tend to price higher than non-wedding shoes (for instance, Bella Belle offers a mid-range price point of $300-$400). If you have your heart set on a high-end designer shoe, expect to pay $600-1000.</p><h3>Where will the wedding take place?</h3><p>An outdoor wedding that takes place on grass may not be the best place to wear stilettos—while an indoor, formal setting may call for a closed-toe shoe.</p><h3>Will there be dancing?</h3><p>If there’s going to be dancing and you love to dance, make sure that whatever shoe you choose, you can easily kick up your heels while wearing them.</p><h2 id=where-should-you-buy-wedding-shoes>Where should you buy wedding shoes?</h2><p>You can buy wedding shoes pretty much anywhere. Most brands have at least a few styles that can work for a wedding.</p><h2 id=what-are-some-popular-trends-in-wedding-shoes>What are some popular trends in wedding shoes?</h2><p>One of the biggest trends in wedding shoes is comfort; things like block heels, short boots, flats, and even sneakers. Don’t be afraid to express your own individuality. If you’re not a person who ever wears stiletto heels and you don’t want to start doing so on your wedding day, there is nothing wrong with that. It’s your day, after all.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Is it OK to wear flat shoes to a wedding?</h3><p>It’s absolutely okay to wear flat shoes to a wedding. Many people have gotten married in flat shoes and many people attend weddings wearing flat shoes. We believe fashion is a personal choice and you should wear what makes you the most comfortable (within reason, of course: If you’re a guest at a wedding with a dress code, please honor that dress code, though you can wear flats with your formal frock if you want).</p><h3>Do wedding shoes have to be white?</h3><p>Wedding shoes do not have to be white. Many brides wear a blue shoe to satisfy the “something blue” and others just like to add a splash of color to the otherwise neutral pallet.</p><h3>How much should I expect to spend on wedding shoes?</h3><p>You can expect to pay anywhere from $39 to $2,000 or more for wedding shoes. Budget shoes may not last much longer than the wedding itself, but there’s no shame in choosing to purchase more wallet-friendly footwear. If you do decide to splurge, you’ll likely be able to wear those shoes for years to come.</p><h3>How can I ensure my wedding shoes fit perfectly?</h3><p>To ensure your wedding shoes fit perfectly, study the designer’s sizing chart first instead of ordering the “size you always wear”—especially if you’re going for sky-high heels. Then, preparation is everything. Many people do a test run by wearing them at home for a day to make sure they won’t end up in excruciating pain after an hour or two. (On a related-to-wedding-prep note, we also encourage you to give your <a rel=alternate href=#>shapewear</a> a test run as well for the same reasons.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lp5qxpbXNoGSsoJ%2BawHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
